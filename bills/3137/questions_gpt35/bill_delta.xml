(c) the level of risk of harm to children presented by different kinds of
content that is harmful to children, giving separate consideration to
children in different age groups;
(d) the level of risk of harm to children presented by content that is harmful
to children which particularly affects individuals with a certain
characteristic or members of a certain group;
(e) the level of risk of functionalities of the service facilitating the presence
or dissemination of content that is harmful to children, identifying and

including functionalities—
(i) enabling adults to search for other users of the service
(including children), and
(ii) enabling adults to contact other users (including children) by
means of the service;
(f) the different ways in which the service is used, and the impact of such
use on the level of risk of harm that might be suffered by children;
(g) the nature, and severity, of the harm that might be suffered by children
from the matters identified in accordance with paragraphs (b) to (f),
giving separate consideration to children in different age groups;
(h) how the design and operation of the service (including the business
model, governance, use of proactive technology, measures to promote
users’ media literacy and safe use of the service, and other systems and
processes) may reduce or increase the risks identified.</quote>

(d) the need to exercise their functions so as to secure that providers of regulated services may comply with such duties by taking measures, or using measures, systems or processes, which are (where relevant) proportionate to—
(i) the size or capacity of the provider in question, and
(ii) the level of risk of harm presented by the service in question, and the severity of the potential harm;
(e) the desirability of promoting the use by providers of regulated services of technologies which are designed to reduce the risk of harm to citizens presented by content on regulated services;

   <quote>131 Provisional notice of contravention
(1) OFCOM may give a notice under this section (a “provisional notice of
contravention”) relating to a regulated service to the provider of the service if
they consider that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the provider
has failed, or is failing, to comply with any enforceable requirement (see
section 132) that applies in relation to the service.
(2) OFCOM may also give a provisional notice of contravention to a person on
either of the grounds in subsection (3).
(3) The grounds are that—
(a) the person has been given an information notice and OFCOM consider
that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person has
failed, or is failing, to comply with either of the duties set out in section
103(7) (duties in relation to information notices), or
(b) the person is required by a skilled person appointed under section 105
to give assistance to the skilled person, and OFCOM consider that there
are reasonable grounds for believing that the person has failed, or is
failing, to comply with the duty set out in subsection (7) of that section
to give such assistance.
(4) A provisional notice of contravention given to a person must—
(a) specify the duty or requirement with which (in OFCOM’s opinion) the
person has failed, or is failing, to comply, and
(b) give OFCOM’s reasons for their opinion that the person has failed, or
is failing, to comply with it.
(5) A provisional notice of contravention may also contain details as mentioned in
subsection (6) or (7), or both.
(6) A provisional notice of contravention may specify steps that OFCOM consider
the person needs to take in order to—
(a) comply with the duty or requirement, or
(b) remedy the failure to comply with it.
(7) A provisional notice of contravention may state that OFCOM propose to
impose a penalty on the person, and in such a case the notice must—
(a) state the reasons why OFCOM propose to impose a penalty,
(b) state whether OFCOM propose to impose a penalty of a single amount,
a penalty calculated by reference to a daily rate, or both penalties (see
section 138(1)),
(c) indicate the amount of a penalty that OFCOM propose to impose,
including (in relation to a penalty calculated by reference to a daily
rate) the daily rate and how the penalty would be calculated,
(d) in relation to a penalty calculated by reference to a daily rate, specify or
describe the period for which OFCOM propose that the penalty should
be payable, and
(e) state the reasons for proposing a penalty of that amount, including any
aggravating or mitigating factors that OFCOM propose to take into
account.
(8) A provisional notice of contravention given to a person must—
(a) state that the person may make representations to OFCOM (with any
supporting evidence) about the matters contained in the notice, and
(b) specify the period within which such representations may be made.
(9) A provisional notice of contravention may be given in respect of a failure to
comply with more than one enforceable requirement.
(10) Where a provisional notice of contravention is given in respect of a continuing
failure, the notice may be given in respect of any period during which the
failure has continued, and must specify that period.
(11) Where a provisional notice of contravention is given to a person in respect of a
failure to comply with a duty or requirement (“the first notice”), a further
provisional notice of contravention in respect of a failure to comply with that
same duty or requirement may be given to the person only—
(a) in respect of a separate instance of the failure after the first notice was
given,
(b) where a period was specified in the first notice in accordance with
subsection (10), in respect of the continuation of the failure after the end
of that period, or
(c) if the first notice has been withdrawn (without a confirmation decision
being given to the person in respect of the failure).</quote>

   <summary>OFCOM may give a provisional notice of contravention to a regulated service provider if they believe there are reasonable grounds for non-compliance with any enforceable requirement. The notice must specify the duty or requirement, provide reasons for non-compliance, and may include steps to comply or remedy the failure. It may also propose a penalty and allow the person to make representations. Multiple notices may be given for continuing failures or separate instances of non-compliance.</summary>

   <subject>Section 134 Confirmation decisions: requirements to take steps</subject>

   <quote>(1) A confirmation decision may require the person to whom it is given to take
such steps as OFCOM consider appropriate (including steps relating to the use
of a system or process) for either or both of the following purposes—
(a) complying with a notified requirement;
(b) remedying the failure to comply with a notified requirement.
(2) But see section 137 in relation to OFCOM’s power to include in a confirmation
decision requirements as described in subsection (1) relating to the use of
proactive technology.
(3) A confirmation decision may impose requirements as described in subsection
(1) only in relation to the design or operation of a regulated service—
(a) in the United Kingdom, or
(b) as it affects United Kingdom users of the service.
(4) A confirmation decision that includes requirements as described in subsection
(1) must—
(a) specify the steps that are required,
(b) give OFCOM’s reasons for their decision to impose those requirements,
(c) specify which of those requirements (if any) have been designated as
CSEA requirements (see subsections (6) and (7)),
(d) specify each notified requirement to which the steps relate,
(e) specify the period during which the failure to comply with a notified
requirement has occurred, and whether the failure is continuing,
(f) specify a reasonable period within which each of the steps specified in
the decision must be taken or, if a step requires the use of a system or
process, a reasonable period within which the system or process must
begin to be used (but see subsection (5) in relation to information
duties),
(g) (if relevant) specify the period for which a system or process must be
used,
(h) contain details of the rights of appeal under section 169, and

   <subject>Section 137 Confirmation decisions: proactive technology</subject>

   <quote>(1) This section sets out what powers OFCOM have to include in a confirmation
decision a requirement to take steps to use a kind, or one of the kinds, of
proactive technology specified in the decision (a “proactive technology
requirement”).
(2) A proactive technology requirement may be imposed in a confirmation
decision if—
(a) the decision is given to the provider of an internet service within
section 81(2), and
(b) the decision is imposed for the purpose of complying with, or
remedying the failure to comply with, the duty set out in section 82(2)
(provider pornographic content).
(3) The following provisions of this section set out constraints on OFCOM’s power
to include a proactive technology requirement in a confirmation decision in
any case not within subsection (2).
(4) A proactive technology requirement may be imposed in a confirmation
decision only if the decision is given to the provider of a Part 3 service.
(5) A proactive technology requirement may be imposed in a confirmation
decision only for the purpose of complying with, or remedying the failure to
comply with, any of the duties set out in—
(a) section 10(2) or (3) (illegal content),
(b) section 12(2) or (3) (children’s online safety),
(c) section 27(2) or (3) (illegal content),
(d) section 29(2) or (3) (children’s online safety), or
(e) section 38(1) or 39(1) (fraudulent advertising).
(6) Proactive technology may be required to be used on or in relation to any Part
3 service or any part of such a service, but if and to the extent that the
technology operates (or may operate) by analysing content that is usergenerated content in relation to the service, or metadata relating to such
content, the technology may not be required to be used except to analyse—
(a) user-generated content communicated publicly, and
(b) metadata relating to user-generated content communicated publicly.
(7) Before imposing a proactive technology requirement in relation to a service in
a confirmation decision, OFCOM must particularly consider the matters
mentioned in subsection (8), so far as they are relevant.</quote>

   <summary>OFCOM has the power to include in a confirmation decision a requirement to use proactive technology to comply with or remedy a failure to comply with certain duties. The requirement can only be imposed on the provider of a Part 3 service and must be for the purpose of complying with duties related to illegal content, children's online safety, or fraudulent advertising. Proactive technology may be required to analyze publicly communicated user-generated content and metadata.</summary>

(a) the person sends a message (see section 183),
(b) the message conveys information that the person knows to be false,
(c) at the time of sending it, the person intended the message, or the
information in it, to cause non-trivial psychological or physical harm to
a likely audience, and
(d) the person has no reasonable excuse for sending the message.
(2) For the purposes of this offence an individual is a “likely audience” of a
message if, at the time the message is sent, it is reasonably foreseeable that the
individual—
(a) would encounter the message, or
(b) in the online context, would encounter a subsequent message
forwarding or sharing the content of the message.
(3) In a case where several or many individuals are a likely audience, it is not
necessary for the purposes of subsection (1)(c) that the person intended to
cause harm to any one of them in particular (or to all of them).
(4) See section 181 for exemptions from the offence under this section.</quote>

   <summary>The bill introduces a new offence for sending false messages with the intention to cause non-trivial psychological or physical harm to a likely audience. The offence applies to messages sent online and does not require the person to intend harm to a specific individual.</summary>

to a provider of a regulated service is to be read as including power to give a
notice to a person who was, at the relevant time, a provider of such a service
but who has ceased to be a provider of such a service (and that Chapter and
Schedules 13 and 15 are to be read accordingly).
(2) “The relevant time” means—

(b) in the case of a notice which relates to the requirement in section 106(1)
to co-operate with an investigation, the time of the failure or possible
failure to which the investigation relates.</quote>

   <summary>The proposed change clarifies that the power to give a notice to a provider of a regulated service also applies to individuals who were providers of such a service but have ceased to be.

   <subject>Section 203 Liability of corporate officers for offences</subject>

   <quote>(1) In this section a “relevant entity” means an entity that is—
(a) the provider of a regulated service, and
(b) a legal person under the law under which it is formed.
(2) If an offence is committed by a relevant entity and it is proved that the
offence—
(a) has been committed with the consent or connivance of an officer of the
entity, or
(b) is attributable to any neglect on the part of an officer of the entity,
the officer (as well as the entity) commits the offence and (subject to section
200(1)) is liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
(3) In relation to an entity which is a body corporate, “officer” means—
(a) a director, manager, associate, secretary or other similar officer, or
(b) a person purporting to act in any such capacity.
In paragraph (a) “director”, in relation to a body corporate whose affairs are
managed by its members, means a member of the body corporate.
(4) In relation to a partnership which is not regarded as a body corporate under
the law under which it is formed, “officer” means—
(a) a partner, or
(b) a person purporting to act as a partner.
(5) In this section—
“body corporate” includes an entity incorporated outside the United
Kingdom;
“offence” means an offence under this Act, except under Part 10.</quote>

   <summary>The proposed change establishes the liability of officers of relevant entities (providers of regulated services that are legal persons) for offences committed by the entity. If it is proven that the offence was committed with the consent or connivance of an officer or due to their neglect, the officer is also liable to be proceeded against and punished. The definition of "officer" varies depending on whether the entity is a body corporate or a partnership.</summary>

   <subject>Section 204 Application of offences to providers that are not legal persons</subject>

   <quote>(1) In this section a “relevant entity” means an entity that—
(a) is the provider of a regulated service, and
(b) is not a legal person under the law under which it is formed.
(2) Proceedings for an offence alleged to have been committed by a relevant entity
must be brought against the entity in its own name (and not in that of any of its
officers or members).
(3) For the purposes of such proceedings—
(a) rules of court relating to the service of documents have effect as if the
entity were a body corporate; and
(b) the following provisions apply as they apply in relation to a body
corporate—
(i) section 33 of the Criminal Justice Act 1925 and Schedule 3 to the
Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980;
(ii) section 18 of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1945
(c. 15 (N.I.)) and Article 166 of, and Schedule 4 to, the
Magistrates’ Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 (S.I. 1981/
1675 (N.I. 26)).
(4) A fine imposed on a relevant entity on its conviction of an offence must be paid
out of the entity’s funds.
(5) If an offence is committed by a relevant entity and it is proved that the
offence—
(a) has been committed with the consent or connivance of an officer of the
entity, or
(b) is attributable to any neglect on the part of an officer of the entity,
the officer (as well as the entity) commits the offence and (subject to section
200(1)) is liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
(6) In relation to a partnership, “officer” means—
(a) a partner, or
(b) a person purporting to act as a partner.
(7) In relation to a relevant entity other than a partnership, “officer” means—
(a) an officer of the entity or a person concerned in the management or
control of the entity, or
(b) a person purporting to act in such a capacity.
(8) Subsection (2) is not to be read as prejudicing any liability of an officer under
subsection (5).
(9) In this section “offence” means an offence under this Act, except under Part 10.</quote>

   <summary>The proposed change specifies that proceedings for an offence alleged to have been committed by a relevant entity (provider of a regulated service that is not a legal person) must be brought against the entity itself and not its officers or members. It also establishes that fines imposed on a relevant entity must be paid out of the entity's funds. Additionally, it clarifies the definition of "officer" for partnerships and other relevant entities.</summary>

   <quote>(1) This section applies in relation to a notice that may or must be given by
OFCOM to a person under any provision of this Act.
(2) OFCOM may give a notice to a person by—
(a) delivering it by hand to the person,
(b) leaving it at the person’s proper address,
(c) sending it by post to the person at that address, or
(d) sending it by email to the person’s email address.

governing body of the entity.
(6) In the case of a notice given to a person who is a provider of a regulated service,
the person’s proper address for the purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of
subsection (2), and section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978 in its application to
those paragraphs, is any address (within or outside the United Kingdom) at
which OFCOM believe, on reasonable grounds, that the notice will come to the
attention of the person or (where the person is an entity) any director or other
officer of that entity.
(7) In the case of a notice given to a person other than a provider of a regulated
service, a person’s proper address for the purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of
subsection (2), and section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978 in its application to
those paragraphs, is—

come to the attention of that person or (where that person is an entity)
any director or other officer of that entity.
(11) A notice sent by email is treated as given 48 hours after it was sent, unless the
contrary is proved.</quote>

   <summary>The proposed change specifies the methods by which OFCOM may give a notice to a person, including delivering it by hand, leaving it at the person's proper address, sending it by post, or sending it by email.

   <quote>18 If a person who is the provider of a relevant regulated service is an exempt
provider, section 85 and Schedule 10 do not apply in relation to the provider
in respect of a transitional charging year (see paragraph 23).

19 (1) If a person who is the provider of a relevant regulated service is not an
exempt provider, section 85 and Schedule 10 apply in relation to the
provider in respect of a transitional charging year.
(2) But sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) apply in relation to the provider in respect of
a transitional charging year if the provider’s notification under section 84 in
relation to that charging year has included details of amounts wholly
referable to a relevant Part 4B service (as mentioned in paragraph 17(3)).
(3) For the purposes of the computation of the provider’s fee under section 85
in respect of the transitional charging year, references in that section to the
provider’s qualifying worldwide revenue are to be taken to be references to
the provider’s non-Part 4B qualifying worldwide revenue.
(4) OFCOM may not require the provider to pay a fee under section 85 in
respect of the transitional charging year if the provider’s non-Part 4B
qualifying worldwide revenue for the qualifying period that relates to that
charging year is less than the threshold figure that has effect for that
charging year.
(5) The amount of a provider’s “non-Part 4B qualifying worldwide revenue” is
the amount that would be the provider’s qualifying worldwide revenue (see
section 86) if all amounts wholly referable to a relevant Part 4B service were
left out of account.</quote>

   <summary>The bill states that if a person who is the provider of a relevant regulated service is an exempt provider, section 85 and Schedule 10 do not apply to the provider in respect of a transitional charging year. However, if the person is not an exempt provider, section 85 and Schedule 10 apply to the provider in respect of a transitional charging year. Additionally, if the provider's notification under section 84 in relation to that charging year has included details of amounts wholly referable to a relevant Part 4B service, the computation of the provider's fee under section 85 is based on the provider's non-Part 4B qualifying worldwide revenue. OFCOM may not require the provider to pay a fee if the provider's non-Part 4B qualifying worldwide revenue is less than the threshold figure for that charging year.</summary>
