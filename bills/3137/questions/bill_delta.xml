   <subject>Procedure for issuing codes of practice</subject>
   <quote>This section sets out the procedure that applies where a draft of a code of practice is laid before Parliament under section 44(11).</quote>
   <quote>The “affirmative procedure” is as follows—
(a) a code of practice in the form of the draft laid before Parliament must not be issued by OFCOM unless the draft has been approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament;
(b) if the draft is so approved, the code of practice comes into force at the end of the period of 21 days beginning with the day on which it is issued;
(c) if the draft is not so approved, OFCOM must prepare another draft of the code of practice under section 41.</quote>
   <quote>The “negative procedure” is as follows—
(a) if, within the 40-day period, either House of Parliament resolves not to approve the draft—
(i) OFCOM must not issue the code of practice in the form of that draft, and
(ii) OFCOM must prepare another draft of the code of practice under section 41;
(b) if no such resolution is made within that period—
(i) OFCOM must issue the code of practice in the form of the draft laid before Parliament, and
(ii) the code of practice comes into force at the end of the period of 21 days beginning with the day on which it is issued.</quote>
   <summary>The bill proposes a new procedure for issuing codes of practice. The procedure is divided into two types: the affirmative procedure and the negative procedure. The affirmative procedure requires approval from both Houses of Parliament before OFCOM can issue a code of practice. If the draft is not approved, OFCOM must prepare another draft. The negative procedure allows OFCOM to issue a code of practice if neither House of Parliament resolves not to approve the draft within a 40-day period.</summary>

(a) appearing to OFCOM to have the skills necessary to prepare a report
about the relevant matters, and
(b) where the appointment is to be made by the provider, nominated or
approved by OFCOM.
(7) It is the duty of—
(a) the provider of the service (“P”),
(b) any person who works for (or used to work for) P, or is providing (or
used to provide) services to P related to the relevant matters, and
(c) other providers of internet services,
to give the skilled person all such assistance as the skilled person may
reasonably require to prepare the report.
(8) The provider of the service is liable for the payment, directly to the skilled
person, of the skilled person’s remuneration and expenses relating to the
preparation of the report.
(9) Subsections (10) to (12) apply in relation to an amount due to a skilled person
under subsection (8).
(10) In England and Wales, such an amount is recoverable—
(a) if the county court so orders, as if it were payable under an order of that
court;
(b) if the High Court so orders, as if it were payable under an order of that
court.
(11) In Scotland, such an amount may be enforced in the same manner as an extract
registered decree arbitral bearing a warrant for execution issued by the sheriff
court of any sheriffdom in Scotland.
(12) In Northern Ireland, such an amount is recoverable—
(a) if a county court so orders, as if it were payable under an order of that

(a) the grounds in section 145(3) or (4) apply in relation to the service, and
(b) either—
(i) a service restriction order under section 145 or an interim service restriction order under section 146 has been made in relation to the failure, and it was not sufficient to prevent significant harm arising to individuals in the United Kingdom as a result of the failure, or
(ii) the likely consequences of the failure are such that if a service restriction order or an interim service restriction order were to be made, it would be unlikely to be sufficient to prevent significant harm arising to individuals in the United Kingdom as a result of the failure,
and in this paragraph, “the failure” means the failure mentioned in section 145(3)(a) or (4)(a) (as the case may be).</quote>

   <quote>(2) An access restriction order is an order imposing requirements on one or more persons who provide an access facility (whether from within or outside the United Kingdom) in relation to a regulated service (see subsection (10)).</quote>

   <quote>(3) An application by OFCOM for an access restriction order must—
(a) specify the regulated service in relation to which the application is made (“the relevant service”),
(b) specify the provider of that service (“the non-compliant provider”),
(c) specify the grounds on which the application is based, and contain evidence about those grounds,
(d) specify the persons on whom (in OFCOM’s opinion) the requirements of the order should be imposed,
(e) contain evidence as to why OFCOM consider that the persons mentioned in paragraph (d) provide an access facility in relation to the relevant service, and specify any such access facility provided,
(f) specify the requirements which OFCOM consider that the order should impose on such persons, and
(g) in the case of an application made without notice having been given to the non-compliant provider, or to the persons mentioned in paragraph (d), state why no notice has been given.</quote>

   <quote>(4) The court may make an access restriction order imposing requirements on a person in relation to the relevant service if the court is satisfied—
(a) as to the grounds in subsection (1),
(b) that the person provides an access facility in relation to the relevant service,
(c) that it is appropriate to make the order for the purpose of preventing significant harm to individuals in the United Kingdom, and the order is proportionate to the risk of such harm,
(d) in the case of an application made on the ground in subsection (3)(c)(iii) or (iv) of section 145 (by virtue of subsection (1)(a)), that it is appropriate to make the order before a provisional notice of contravention or confirmation decision has been given, or before compliance with requirements imposed by a confirmation decision has been ascertained (as the case may be), and
(e) if no notice of the application has been given to the non-compliant provider, or to the persons on whom requirements are being imposed, that it is appropriate to make the order without notice.</quote>

   <quote>(5) When considering whether to make an access restriction order in relation to the relevant service, and when considering what provision it should contain, the court must take into account (among other things) the rights and obligations of all relevant parties, including those of—
(a) the non-compliant provider,
(b) the person or persons on whom the court is considering imposing the requirements, and
(c) United Kingdom users of the relevant service.</quote>

   <quote>(6) An access restriction order made in relation to the relevant service must—
(a) identify the non-compliant provider,
(b) identify the persons on whom the requirements are imposed, and any access facility to which the requirements relate,
(c) require such persons to take the steps specified in the order, or to put in place arrangements, to withdraw, adapt or manipulate the access facility in order to impede users’ access (by means of that facility) to the relevant service (or to part of it),
(d) specify the date by which the requirements in the order must be complied with, and
(e) specify the date on which the order expires, or the period for which the order has effect.</quote>

   <quote>(7) The steps that may be specified or arrangements that may be required to be put in place—
(a) include steps or arrangements that will or may require the termination of an agreement (whether or not made before the coming into force of this section), or the prohibition of the performance of such an agreement,
(b) are limited, so far as that is possible, to steps or arrangements that impede the access of United Kingdom users, and

   <quote>(10) For the purposes of this section, a facility is an “access facility” in relation to a regulated service if the person who provides the facility is able to withdraw, adapt or manipulate it in such a way as to impede access (by means of that facility) to the regulated service (or to part of it) by United Kingdom users of that service.</quote>

   <quote>(11) Examples of access facilities include—
(a) internet access services by means of which a regulated service is made available, and
(b) app stores through which a mobile app for a regulated service may be downloaded or otherwise accessed.</quote>

   <quote>(12) In this section—
“the court” means—
(a) in England and Wales, the High Court or the county court,
(b) in Scotland, the Court of Session or a sheriff, and

“facility” means any kind of service, infrastructure or apparatus enabling users of a regulated service to access the regulated service;
“internet access service” means a service that provides access to virtually all (or just some) of the end points of the internet.</quote>

   <summary>The proposed change introduces the concept of an "access restriction order" that OFCOM can apply for in court. This order can be applied to a regulated service if OFCOM believes that a service restriction order or an interim service restriction order has been insufficient in preventing significant harm to individuals in the UK. The order imposes requirements on one or more persons who provide an access facility to the regulated service.

The court can make an access restriction order if it is satisfied with the grounds, that the person provides an access facility in relation to the relevant service, that it is appropriate to make the order for the purpose of preventing significant harm to individuals in the UK, and the order is proportionate to the risk of such harm. The court must take into account the rights and obligations of all relevant parties when considering whether to make an access restriction order. The order must identify the non-compliant provider, the persons on whom the requirements are imposed, and any access facility to which the requirements relate. It must also require such persons to take the steps specified in the order, or to put in place arrangements, to withdraw, adapt or manipulate the access facility in order to impede users’ access to the relevant service. The order must specify the date by which the requirements in the order must be complied with, and the date on which the order expires, or the period for which the order has effect. The steps that may be specified or arrangements that may be required to be put in place include steps or arrangements that will or may require the termination of an agreement, or the prohibition of the performance of such an agreement. These steps or arrangements are limited, so far as that is possible, to steps or arrangements that impede the access of UK users, and are limited, so far as that is possible, to steps or arrangements that do not affect such users’ ability to access any other internet services.

   <quote>“11A Regulated services: media literacy strategy and media literacy statement
(1) OFCOM must prepare and publish a media literacy strategy within the period of one year beginning with the day on which the Online Safety Act 2023 is passed.
(2) A media literacy strategy is a plan setting out how OFCOM propose to exercise their functions under section 11 in the period covered by the plan, which must be not more than three years.
(3) In particular, a media literacy strategy must state OFCOM’s objectives and priorities for the period it covers.
(4) Before the end of the period covered by a media literacy strategy, OFCOM must prepare and publish a media literacy strategy for a further period, ensuring that each successive strategy covers a period beginning immediately after the end of the last one.
(5) In preparing or revising a media literacy strategy, OFCOM must consult such persons as they consider appropriate.
(6) OFCOM’s annual report must contain a media literacy statement.
(7) A media literacy statement is a statement by OFCOM—
(a) summarising what they have done in the financial year to which the report relates in the exercise of their functions under section 11, and
(b) assessing what progress has been made towards achieving the objectives and priorities set out in their media literacy strategy in that year.
(8) A media literacy statement must include a summary and an evaluation of the activities and initiatives pursued or commissioned by OFCOM in the exercise of their functions under section 11 in the financial year to which the report relates.
(9) The first annual report that is required to contain a media literacy statement is the report for the financial year during which OFCOM’s first media literacy strategy is published, and that first statement is to relate to the period from publication day until the end of that financial year.
(10) But if OFCOM’s first media literacy strategy is published during the second half of a financial year—
(a) the first annual report that is required to contain a media literacy statement is the report for the next financial year, and
(b) that first statement is to relate to the period from publication day until the end of that financial year.
(11) References in this section to OFCOM’s functions under section 11 are to those functions so far as they relate to regulated services.
(12) In this section—
“annual report” means OFCOM’s annual report under paragraph 12 of the Schedule to the Office of Communications Act 2002;
“financial year” means a year ending with 31 March.”</quote>
   <summary>The bill proposes the addition of a new section to the Communications Act, requiring OFCOM to prepare and publish a media literacy strategy within one year of the Online Safety Act 2023 being passed.

   <summary>The bill introduces new regulations regarding penalties imposed by OFCOM. It sets a maximum penalty amount of £18 million or 10% of a person's qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is greater. It also stipulates that a penalty cannot be of a different kind, a greater amount, or payable over a longer period than that proposed in the earlier notice. In cases where two or more entities are jointly and severally liable for a penalty, modifications are made to these rules. The bill also outlines how penalties can be recovered in England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.</summary>

   <pillars>
     <pillar type="Economic Impact">
      The new regulations could have significant economic implications for entities that violate the rules, especially those with high worldwide revenues. The maximum penalty amount being set at 10% of a person's qualifying worldwide revenue could result in substantial fines for large corporations.
     </pillar>
     <pillar type="Justice System">
      The bill provides clear guidelines on how penalties can be imposed and recovered, which could streamline the enforcement process and ensure consistency in the application of penalties.
