The Online Safety Bill establishes a new regulatory framework, enforced by OFCOM, aimed at improving online safety, particularly for children. This bill categorizes internet services into user-to-user services, search services, and combined services.

New duties and requirements are imposed on online services, which include the obligation to protect users from illegal content and activities, assess risks for services likely accessed by children and protect them from harmful content, verify users' identities for certain services, and provide transparency reports about content removals, complaints, and more.

The bill grants new powers to OFCOM, giving it audit and inspection capabilities related to regulated services. It also allows the regulator to issue notices dealing with terrorist content and child sexual exploitation/abuse content, and impose financial penalties for non-compliance.

Specific regulations are imposed to prevent children from accessing pornographic content on these services. Furthermore, the bill creates offences related to harmful online communications, which include the transmission of false information, flashing images, encouraging self-harm, and sharing intimate images without consent. Existing laws around cyberbullying and revenge porn are also repealed.

## Key aspects:

1. **Child Safety**: The bill introduces new duties on service providers to protect children from harmful content online, including preventing access to pornography and other age-restricted content, and safeguarding against risks like bullying, self-harm, or eating disorders.

2. **Transparency Reporting**: The bill requires social media platforms and similar companies to publish transparency reports detailing their handling of harmful content. This provides citizens with insight into how these platforms address issues like misinformation, hate speech, and terrorist content.

3. **Illegal Content**: The bill obligates companies to minimize users' exposure to clearly illegal content, such as child sexual abuse material, terrorist content, and images shared without consent.

4. **Free Speech Protections**: Companies are required to protect users' rights to freedom of expression when implementing safety measures and policies, ensuring that safety efforts won't infringe upon legitimate free speech.

5. **User Empowerment**: The bill stipulates that companies implement features allowing users to control the content they see, such as filtering and blocking tools, empowering users to shape their own online experiences.

6. **Complaints Procedures**: Companies must establish easy-to-use complaint systems for users to flag inappropriate or illegal content.

In summary, the Online Safety Bill attempts to strike a balance between safety and freedom of expression online, introducing new obligations and responsibilities for online service providers, while also providing users with tools and avenues to control and influence their online experiences.
