are as follows—
(a) the kind of service it is;
(b) the functionalities of the service;
(c) the user base of the service;
(d) in the case of a notice relating to a user-to-user service (or to the userto-user part of a combined service), the prevalence of relevant content
on the service, and the extent of its dissemination by means of the
service;
(e) in the case of a notice relating to a search service (or to the search engine
of a combined service), the prevalence of search content of the service
that is relevant content;
(f) the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom
presented by relevant content, and the severity of that harm;
(g) the systems and processes used by the service which are designed to
identify and remove relevant content;
(h) the contents of the skilled person’s report obtained as required by
section 123;
(i) the extent to which the use of the specified technology would or might
result in interference with users’ right to freedom of expression within
the law;
(j) the level of risk of the use of the specified technology resulting in a
breach of any statutory provision or rule of law concerning privacy that
is relevant to the use or operation of the service (including, but not
limited to, any such provision or rule concerning the processing of
personal data);
(k) in the case of a notice relating to a user-to-user service (or to the userto-user part of a combined service), the extent to which the use of the
specified technology would or might—
(i) have an adverse impact on the availability of journalistic
content on the service, or
(ii) result in a breach of the confidentiality of journalistic sources;
(l) whether the use of any less intrusive measures than the specified
technology would be likely to achieve a significant reduction in the
amount of relevant content.</quote>

   <quote>126 Notices under section 122(1): supplementary
(1) In this section “a notice” means a notice under section 122(1) (including a
further notice under that provision).
(2) If a provider is already using accredited technology in relation to the service in
question, a notice may require the provider to use it more effectively
(specifying the ways in which that must be done).
(3) A notice relating to a user-to-user service (or to the user-to-user part of a
combined service) may also require a provider to operate an effective
complaints procedure allowing for United Kingdom users to challenge the
provider for taking down content which they have generated, uploaded or
shared on the service.
(4) A notice relating to a search service (or to the search engine of a combined
service) may also require a provider to operate an effective complaints
procedure allowing for an interested person (see section 228(7)) to challenge
measures taken or in use by the provider that result in content relating to that
interested person no longer appearing in search results of the service.
(5) A notice given to a provider of a Part 3 service requiring the use of accredited
technology is to be taken to require the provider to make such changes to the
design or operation of the service as are necessary for the technology to be used
effectively.
(6) A notice requiring the use of accredited technology must—
(a) give OFCOM’s reasons for their decision to give the notice,
(b) contain details of the requirements imposed by the notice,
(c) contain details of the technology to be used,
(d) contain details about the manner in which the technology is to be
implemented,
(e) specify a reasonable period for compliance with the notice,
(f) specify the period for which the notice is to have effect,
(g) contain details of the rights of appeal under section 169,
(h) contain information about when OFCOM intend to review the notice
(see section 127), and
(i) contain information about the consequences of not complying with the
notice (including information about the further kinds of enforcement
action that it would be open to OFCOM to take).</quote>

   <quote>127 Review and further notice under section 122(1)
(1) This section applies where OFCOM have given a provider of a Part 3 service a
notice under section 122(1).
(2) The power conferred by section 126(11) includes power to revoke the notice if
there are reasonable grounds for believing that the provider is failing to
comply with it.
(3) If a notice is revoked as mentioned in subsection (2), OFCOM may give the
provider a further notice under section 122(1) if they consider that it is
necessary and proportionate to do so (taking into account the matters
mentioned in section 125).
(4) Except where a notice under section 122(1) is revoked as mentioned in
subsection (2), OFCOM must carry out a review of the provider’s compliance
with the notice—
(a) in the case of a notice requiring the use of accredited technology, before
the end of the period for which the notice has effect;
(b) in the case of a notice relating to the development or sourcing of
technology, before the last date by which any step specified in the
notice is required to be taken.
(5) In the case of a notice requiring the use of accredited technology, the review
must consider—
(a) the extent to which the technology specified in the notice has been used,
and
(b) the effectiveness of its use.
(6) Following the review, and after consultation with the provider, OFCOM may
give the provider a further notice under section 122(1) if they consider that it is
necessary and proportionate to do so (taking into account the matters
mentioned in section 125).
(7) If a further notice under section 122(1) is given, subsections (3) to (6) apply
again.
(8) A further notice under section 122(1) may impose different requirements from
an earlier notice under that provision.
(9) Sections 123 (skilled person’s report) and 124 (warning notices) do not apply
in relation to a further notice under section 122(1).</quote>

(1) OFCOM may give a notice under this section (a “provisional notice of
contravention”) relating to a regulated service to the provider of the service if
they consider that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the provider
has failed, or is failing, to comply with any enforceable requirement (see
section 132) that applies in relation to the service.
(2) OFCOM may also give a provisional notice of contravention to a person on
either of the grounds in subsection (3).
(3) The grounds are that—
(a) the person has been given an information notice and OFCOM consider
that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person has
failed, or is failing, to comply with either of the duties set out in section
103(7) (duties in relation to information notices), or
(b) the person is required by a skilled person appointed under section 105
to give assistance to the skilled person, and OFCOM consider that there
are reasonable grounds for believing that the person has failed, or is
failing, to comply with the duty set out in subsection (7) of that section
to give such assistance.
(4) A provisional notice of contravention given to a person must—
(a) specify the duty or requirement with which (in OFCOM’s opinion) the
person has failed, or is failing, to comply, and
(b) give OFCOM’s reasons for their opinion that the person has failed, or
is failing, to comply with it.
(5) A provisional notice of contravention may also contain details as mentioned in
subsection (6) or (7), or both.
(6) A provisional notice of contravention may specify steps that OFCOM consider
the person needs to take in order to—
(a) comply with the duty or requirement, or
(b) remedy the failure to comply with it.</quote>

   <quote>This section sets out what powers OFCOM have to include in a confirmation
decision a requirement to take steps to use a kind, or one of the kinds, of
proactive technology specified in the decision (a “proactive technology
requirement”).</quote>

   <summary>The proposed change inserts a new subsection (1) to Section 137, which explains the powers of OFCOM to include a requirement in a confirmation decision to use proactive technology. Proactive technology refers to a specified kind or kinds of technology that can be used to comply with or remedy a failure to comply with certain duties.</summary>

   <quote>A confirmation decision may require the person to whom it is given to do
either or both of the following, depending on what was proposed in the
provisional notice of contravention (see paragraph 3 of Schedule 13)—
(a) pay to OFCOM a penalty of a single amount in sterling determined by
OFCOM (a “single penalty”) and specified in the confirmation decision;
(b) if the confirmation decision includes a requirement of the kind
described in section 134(1)(a) in respect of a continuous failure to
comply with a notified requirement, pay a daily rate penalty to
OFCOM if that same failure continues after the compliance date.</quote>

   <summary>The proposed change inserts a new subsection (1) to Section 138, which outlines the powers of OFCOM to require a person to pay a penalty in a confirmation decision. The penalty can be a single amount or a daily rate penalty, depending on the nature of the failure to comply with a notified requirement.</summary>

   <quote>As well as containing the information mentioned in subsection (5), a
confirmation decision that imposes a daily rate penalty in respect of a
continuous failure to comply with a notified requirement must—
(a) state the daily rate of the penalty and how the penalty is calculated;
(b) state that the person will be liable to pay the penalty if that same failure
continues after the compliance date;
(c) state the date from which the penalty begins to be payable, which must
not be earlier than the day after the compliance date;
(d) provide for the penalty to continue to be payable at the daily rate
until—
(i) the date on which the notified requirement is complied with,
(ii) if the penalty is imposed in respect of a failure to comply with
more than one notified requirement, the date on which the last
of those requirements is complied with, or

(3) The grounds mentioned in subsection (1)(a) are that—
(a) the provider of the regulated service has failed to comply with an
enforceable requirement that applies in relation to the regulated
service,
(b) the failure is continuing, and
(c) any of the following applies—
(i) the provider has failed to comply with a requirement imposed
by a confirmation decision that is of a kind described in section
134(1) relating to the failure;
(ii) the provider has failed to pay a penalty imposed by a
confirmation decision relating to the failure (and the
confirmation decision did not impose any requirements of a
kind described in section 134(1));
(iii) the provider would be likely to fail to comply with
requirements imposed by a confirmation decision if given;
(iv) the circumstances of the failure or the risks of harm to
individuals in the United Kingdom are such that it is
appropriate to make the application without having given a
provisional notice of contravention, without having given a
confirmation decision, or (having given a confirmation decision
imposing requirements) without waiting to ascertain
compliance with those requirements.

(2) An interim service restriction order is an interim order imposing requirements
on one or more persons who provide an ancillary service (whether from within

with an enforceable requirement that applies in relation to the
regulated service, and
(b) the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom relating

(2) A media literacy strategy is a plan setting out how OFCOM propose to
exercise their functions under section 11 in the period covered by the
plan, which must be not more than three years.
(3) In particular, a media literacy strategy must state OFCOM’s objectives
and priorities for the period it covers.
(4) Before the end of the period covered by a media literacy strategy,
OFCOM must prepare and publish a media literacy strategy for a
further period, ensuring that each successive strategy covers a period
beginning immediately after the end of the last one.
(5) In preparing or revising a media literacy strategy, OFCOM must
consult such persons as they consider appropriate.
(6) OFCOM’s annual report must contain a media literacy statement.
(7) A media literacy statement is a statement by OFCOM—
(a) summarising what they have done in the financial year to which
the report relates in the exercise of their functions under section
11, and
(b) assessing what progress has been made towards achieving the
objectives and priorities set out in their media literacy strategy
in that year.
(8) A media literacy statement must include a summary and an evaluation
of the activities and initiatives pursued or commissioned by OFCOM in
the exercise of their functions under section 11 in the financial year to
which the report relates.
(9) The first annual report that is required to contain a media literacy
statement is the report for the financial year during which OFCOM’s
first media literacy strategy is published, and that first statement is to
relate to the period from publication day until the end of that financial
year.
(10) But if OFCOM’s first media literacy strategy is published during the
second half of a financial year—
(a) the first annual report that is required to contain a media
literacy statement is the report for the next financial year, and
(b) that first statement is to relate to the period from publication
day until the end of that financial year.

those functions so far as they relate to regulated services.

be, or presents a material risk of—
(a) causing significant harm to users of the services or members of the

users of the service or members of the public.
(3) An entity is an “eligible entity” if the entity meets criteria specified in

(ii) provide higher levels of protection for children than for adults,
(iii) provide transparency and accountability to users in relation to
actions taken to comply with duties set out in Chapter 2, 3, 4 or
5 of Part 3, Chapter 1, 3 or 4 of Part 4, or Part 5,
(iv) protect the right of users and (in the case of search services or
combined services) interested persons to freedom of expression
within the law, and
(v) protect users from a breach of any statutory provision or rule of
law concerning privacy that is relevant to the use or operation
of a regulated service (including, but not limited to, any such
provision or rule concerning the processing of personal data);
and
(b) ensuring that regulation of services is proportionate, having regard to
the level of risk of harm presented by regulated services of different
kinds and to the size and capacity of providers.</quote>
   <quote>(4) The review must also, in particular, consider—
(a) the effectiveness of—
(i) the information gathering and information sharing powers
available to OFCOM, and
(ii) the enforcement powers available to OFCOM; and
(b) the extent to which OFCOM have had regard to the desirability of
encouraging innovation by providers of regulated services.</quote>
   <quote>(5) In carrying out the review, the Secretary of State must consult—
(a) OFCOM, and
(b) such other persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.</quote>
   <quote>(6) In carrying out the review, the Secretary of State must take into account any
report published by OFCOM under section 159 (reports about news publisher
content and journalistic content).</quote>
   <quote>(7) The Secretary of State must produce and publish a report on the outcome of the
review.</quote>
   <quote>(8) The report must be laid before Parliament.</quote>
   <quote>(9) In subsection (3) “content on regulated services” means—
(a) regulated user-generated content present on regulated services,
(b) search content of regulated services,
(c) fraudulent advertisements present on regulated services, and
(d) regulated provider pornographic content published or displayed on
regulated services.</quote>
   <quote>(10) In subsection (9)—
“fraudulent advertisement” has the meaning given by section 38 or 39
(depending on the kind of service in question);
“regulated user-generated content” has the same meaning as in Part 3 (see
section 55);
“regulated provider pornographic content” and “published or displayed”
have the same meaning as in Part 5 (see section 80);
“search content” has the same meaning as in Part 3 (see section 57).</quote>

   <summary>The proposed amendment requires the Secretary of State to review the operation of the regulatory framework provided by the Act and section 11 of the Communications Act as it relates to regulated services. The review must consider the effectiveness of the regulatory framework in minimizing harm, protecting users' rights, and ensuring proportionate regulation. It must also consider the effectiveness of OFCOM's information gathering and enforcement powers, as well as their encouragement of innovation by regulated service providers. The Secretary of State must consult with OFCOM and other relevant parties, take into account any reports published by OFCOM, and produce and publish a report on the outcome of the review.</summary>

   <subject>False communications offence</subject>

   <quote>(1) A person commits an offence if—
(a) the person sends a message (see section 183),
(b) the message conveys information that the person knows to be false,
(c) at the time of sending it, the person intended the message, or the
information in it, to cause non-trivial psychological or physical harm to
a likely audience, and
(d) the person has no reasonable excuse for sending the message.</quote>
   <quote>(2) For the purposes of this offence an individual is a “likely audience” of a
message if, at the time the message is sent, it is reasonably foreseeable that the
individual—
(a) would encounter the message, or
(b) in the online context, would encounter a subsequent message
forwarding or sharing the content of the message.</quote>
   <quote>(3) In a case where several or many individuals are a likely audience, it is not
necessary for the purposes of subsection (1)(c) that the person intended to
cause harm to any one of them in particular (or to all of them).</quote>
   <quote>(4) See section 181 for exemptions from the offence under this section.</quote>
   <quote>(5) A person who commits an offence under this section is liable—
(a) on summary conviction in England and Wales, to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding the maximum term for summary offences or a fine
(or both);
(b) on summary conviction in Northern Ireland, to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding 6 months or a fine not exceeding level 5 on the
standard scale (or both).</quote>
   <quote>(6) In subsection (5)(a) “the maximum term for summary offences” means—
(a) if the offence is committed before the time when section 281(5) of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003 comes into force, 6 months;
(b) if the offence is committed after that time, 51 weeks.</quote>
   <quote>(7) Proceedings for an offence under this section may be brought within the period
of 6 months beginning with the date on which evidence sufficient in the
opinion of the prosecutor to justify the proceedings comes to the prosecutor’s
knowledge.</quote>
   <quote>(8) But such proceedings may not be brought by virtue of subsection (7) more than
3 years after the commission of the offence.</quote>
   <quote>(9) A certificate signed by the prosecutor as to the date on which the evidence in
question came to the prosecutor’s knowledge is conclusive evidence of the date
on which it did so; and a certificate to that effect and purporting to be so signed
is to be treated as being so signed unless the contrary is proved.</quote>
   <quote>(10) In subsection (9)—
“fraudulent advertisement” has the meaning given by section 38 or 39
(depending on the kind of service in question);
“regulated user-generated content” has the same meaning as in Part 3 (see
section 55);
“regulated provider pornographic content” and “published or displayed”
have the same meaning as in Part 5 (see section 80);
“search content” has the same meaning as in Part 3 (see section 57).</quote>

   <summary>The proposed amendment introduces a new offence of sending false communications with the intention to cause non-trivial harm to a likely audience. It defines "likely audience" in the context of online messages and provides penalties for the offence. It also sets time limits for bringing proceedings and allows for a certificate from the prosecutor regarding the date of evidence coming to their knowledge.</summary>

(a) A sends a communication by electronic means which consists of or
includes flashing images (see subsection (13)),
(b) either condition 1 or condition 2 is met, and
(c) A has no reasonable excuse for sending the communication.</quote>

professional acting in that capacity.</quote>
   <quote>(10) A person who commits an offence under subsection (1) or (8) is liable—

term not exceeding 6 months or a fine not exceeding the statutory
maximum (or both);
(c) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
5 years or a fine (or both).</quote>
   <quote>(11) It does not matter for the purposes of this section whether flashing images may
be viewed at once (for example, a GIF that plays automatically) or only after
some action is performed (for example, pressing play).</quote>
   <quote>(12) In this section—
(a) references to sending a communication include references to causing a
communication to be sent;
(b) references to showing flashing images include references to causing
flashing images to be shown.</quote>
   <quote>(13) In this section—
“electronic communications device” means equipment or a device that is
capable of transmitting images by electronic means;
“flashing images” means images which carry a risk that an individual
with photosensitive epilepsy who viewed them would suffer a seizure

(b) alarm or distress;
“individual with epilepsy” includes, but is not limited to, an individual

read accordingly).</quote>

   <summary>The proposed amendment introduces offences for sending or showing flashing images that could cause harm to individuals with epilepsy. It sets conditions for the offence, provides exemptions, and outlines penalties for the offence. It also defines terms related to the offence.</summary>

   <subject>Offence of encouraging or assisting serious self-harm</subject>

   <quote>(1) A person (D) commits an offence if—
(a) D does a relevant act capable of encouraging or assisting the serious
self-harm of another person, and
(b) D’s act was intended to encourage or assist the serious self-harm of
another person.</quote>
   <quote>(2) D “does a relevant act” if D—
(a) communicates in person,
(b) sends, transmits or publishes a communication by electronic means,
(c) shows a person such a communication,
(d) publishes material by any means other than electronic means,
(e) sends, gives, shows or makes available to a person—
(i) material published as mentioned in paragraph (d), or
(ii) any form of correspondence, or
(f) sends, gives or makes available to a person an item on which data is
stored electronically.</quote>
   <quote>(3) “Serious self-harm” means self-harm amounting to—
(a) in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, grievous bodily harm
within the meaning of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, and
(b) in Scotland, severe injury,
and includes successive acts of self-harm which cumulatively reach that
threshold.</quote>
   <quote>(4) The person referred to in subsection (1)(a) and (b) need not be a specific person
(or class of persons) known to, or identified by, D.</quote>
   <quote>(5) D may commit an offence under this section whether or not serious self-harm
occurs.</quote>
   <quote>(6) If a person (D1) arranges for a person (D2) to do an act that is capable of
encouraging or assisting the serious self-harm of another person and D2 does
that act, D1 is to be treated as also having done it.</quote>
   <quote>(7) In the application of subsection (1) to an act by D involving an electronic
communication or a publication in physical form, it does not matter whether
the content of the communication or publication is created by D (so for
example, in the online context, the offence under this section may be
committed by forwarding another person’s direct message or sharing another
person’s post).</quote>
   <quote>(8) In the application of subsection (1) to the sending, transmission or publication
by electronic means of a communication consisting of or including a hyperlink
to other content, the reference in subsection (2)(b) to the communication is to
be read as including a reference to content accessed directly via the hyperlink.</quote>
   <quote>(9) In the application of subsection (1) to an act by D involving an item on which
data is stored electronically, the reference in subsection (2)(f) to the item is to
be read as including a reference to content accessed by means of the item to
which the person in receipt of the item is specifically directed by D.</quote>
   <quote>(10) A provider of an internet service by means of which a communication is sent,
transmitted or published is not to be regarded as a person who sends, transmits
or publishes it.</quote>
   <quote>(11) Any reference in this section to doing an act that is capable of encouraging the
serious self-harm of another person includes a reference to doing so by
threatening another person or otherwise putting pressure on another person to
seriously self-harm.
“Seriously self-harm” is to be interpreted consistently with subsection (3).</quote>
   <quote>(12) Any reference to an act in this section, except in subsection (3), includes a
reference to a course of conduct, and references to doing an act are to be read
accordingly.</quote>

   <summary>The proposed amendment introduces an offence of encouraging or assisting serious self-harm. It defines the relevant acts that constitute the offence, provides a definition of "serious self-harm," and clarifies that the offence can be committed even if serious self-harm does not occur. It also includes provisions for arrangements and extends the application of the offence to electronic communications and publications.</summary>
