The Online Safety Bill, while imposing duties on tech companies to remove harmful content, sparks significant concerns. The expanded powers of OFCOM and mandatory monitoring technology could infringe on privacy and risk over-filtering content. New online communication offenses might stifle free speech, and identity verification requirements could exclude marginalized groups. With the potential to undermine encryption and giving tech companies the power to restrict access, the bill could impact digital rights and civil liberties.
