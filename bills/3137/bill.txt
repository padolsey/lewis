matters mentioned in subsection (5)(a) and (b).
Interpretation

for the purpose of compliance with a duty, or to taking or using relevant
recommended measures, are to taking or using such of those measures as are
relevant to the provider and the service in question.

failure, the notice may be given in respect of any period during which the
failure has continued, and must specify that period.
(11) Where a provisional notice of contravention is given to a person in respect of a
failure to comply with a duty or requirement (“the first notice”), a further
provisional notice of contravention in respect of a failure to comply with that
same duty or requirement may be given to the person only—

service,
(c) that it is appropriate to make the order for the purpose of preventing
harm to individuals in the United Kingdom, and the order is
proportionate to the risk of such harm,
(d) in the case of an application made on the ground in subsection (3)(c)(iii)
or (iv), that it is appropriate to make the order before a provisional
notice of contravention or confirmation decision has been given, or
before compliance with requirements imposed by a confirmation

in place—
(a) include steps or arrangements that will or may require the termination
of an agreement (whether or not made before the coming into force of
this section), or the prohibition of the performance of such an
agreement, and
(b) are limited, so far as that is possible, to steps or arrangements relating
to the operation of the relevant service as it affects United Kingdom
users.
(10) OFCOM must inform the Secretary of State as soon as reasonably practicable
after a service restriction order has been made.
(11) For the purposes of this section, a service is an “ancillary service” in relation to

or outside the United Kingdom) in relation to a regulated service (see
subsection (9)).
(3) The grounds mentioned in subsection (1)(a) are that—
(a) it is likely that the provider of the regulated service is failing to comply
with an enforceable requirement that applies in relation to the
regulated service, and
(b) the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom relating

that it would not be appropriate to wait to establish the failure before
applying for the order.
(4) The grounds mentioned in subsection (1)(b) are that—
(a) it is likely that the provider of the Part 3 service is failing to comply with
a notice under section 122(1) that relates to the service (notices to deal
with terrorism content and CSEA content), and

mentioned in paragraph (d) provide an ancillary service in relation to
the relevant service, and specify any such ancillary service provided,
(f) specify the requirements which OFCOM consider that the order should

(g) in the case of an application made without notice having been given to
the non-compliant provider, or to the persons mentioned in paragraph
(d), state why no notice has been given.
(6) The court may make an interim service restriction order imposing
requirements on a person in relation to the relevant service if the court is
satisfied—
(a) as to the ground in subsection (3)(a) or the ground in subsection (4)(a)
(as the case may be),
(b) that the person provides an ancillary service in relation to the relevant
service,
(c) that there are prima facie grounds to suggest that an application for a
service restriction order under section 145 would be successful,
(d) that the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom

(whichever applies), and the nature and severity of that harm, are such

(e) if no notice of the application has been given to the non-compliant
provider, or to the persons on whom requirements are being imposed,
that it is appropriate to make the order without notice.

in the order expires (as the case may be), and
(b) the date on which the court makes a service restriction order under
section 145 in relation to the relevant service that imposes requirements
on the same persons on whom requirements are imposed by the
interim order, or dismisses the application for such an order.
(8) Subsections (7) to ((10) of section 145 apply in relation to an interim service
restriction order under this section as they apply in relation to a service
restriction order under that section.
(9) In this section, “ancillary service” and “the court” have the same meaning as in
section 145 (see subsections (11), (12) and (13) of that section).
147 Access restriction orders
(1) OFCOM may apply to the court for an order under this section (an “access
restriction order”) in relation to a regulated service where they consider that—
(a) the grounds in section 145(3) or (4) apply in relation to the service, and
(b) either—
(i) a service restriction order under section 145 or an interim
service restriction order under section 146 has been made in
relation to the failure, and it was not sufficient to prevent
significant harm arising to individuals in the United Kingdom
as a result of the failure, or
(ii) the likely consequences of the failure are such that if a service
restriction order or an interim service restriction order were to
be made, it would be unlikely to be sufficient to prevent
significant harm arising to individuals in the United Kingdom

mentioned in paragraph (d) provide an access facility in relation to the
relevant service, and specify any such access facility provided,

(f) specify the requirements which OFCOM consider that the order should
impose on such persons, and
(g) in the case of an application made without notice having been given to
the non-compliant provider, or to the persons mentioned in paragraph
(d), state why no notice has been given.
(4) The court may make an access restriction order imposing requirements on a
person in relation to the relevant service if the court is satisfied—
(a) as to the grounds in subsection (1),
(b) that the person provides an access facility in relation to the relevant
service,
(c) that it is appropriate to make the order for the purpose of preventing
significant harm to individuals in the United Kingdom, and the order
is proportionate to the risk of such harm,
(d) in the case of an application made on the ground in subsection (3)(c)(iii)
or (iv) of section 145 (by virtue of subsection (1)(a)), that it is
appropriate to make the order before a provisional notice of
contravention or confirmation decision has been given, or before
compliance with requirements imposed by a confirmation decision has
been ascertained (as the case may be), and
(e) if no notice of the application has been given to the non-compliant
provider, or to the persons on whom requirements are being imposed,
that it is appropriate to make the order without notice.

relevant service, and when considering what provision it should contain, the
court must take into account (among other things) the rights and obligations of
all relevant parties, including those of—
(a) the non-compliant provider,
(b) the person or persons on whom the court is considering imposing the
requirements, and
(c) United Kingdom users of the relevant service.
(6) An access restriction order made in relation to the relevant service must—
(a) identify the non-compliant provider,
(b) identify the persons on whom the requirements are imposed, and any
access facility to which the requirements relate,
(c) require such persons to take the steps specified in the order, or to put in
place arrangements, to withdraw, adapt or manipulate the access
facility in order to impede users’ access (by means of that facility) to the
relevant service (or to part of it),
(d) specify the date by which the requirements in the order must be
complied with, and
(e) specify the date on which the order expires, or the period for which the
order has effect.
(7) The steps that may be specified or arrangements that may be required to be put
in place—

not affect such users’ ability to access any other internet services.
(8) OFCOM must inform the Secretary of State as soon as reasonably practicable
after an access restriction order has been made.

arrangements required by an access restriction order, OFCOM may, by notice,
require that person to (where possible) notify persons in the United Kingdom
who attempt to access the relevant service via that facility of the access
restriction order (and where a confirmation decision has been given to the noncompliant provider, the notification must refer to that decision).
(10) For the purposes of this section, a facility is an “access facility” in relation to a
regulated service if the person who provides the facility is able to withdraw,
adapt or manipulate it in such a way as to impede access (by means of that
facility) to the regulated service (or to part of it) by United Kingdom users of
that service.
(11) Examples of access facilities include—

“facility” means any kind of service, infrastructure or apparatus enabling
users of a regulated service to access the regulated service;
“internet access service” means a service that provides access to virtually
all (or just some) of the end points of the internet.

“interim access restriction order”) in relation to a regulated service where they
consider that—
(a) the grounds in section 146(3) or (4) apply in relation to the service, and
(b) either—
(i) a service restriction order under section 145 or an interim
service restriction order under section 146 has been made in
relation to the likely failure, and it was not sufficient to prevent
significant harm arising to individuals in the United Kingdom
as a result of the failure, or
(ii) the likely consequences of such a failure would be such that if a
service restriction order or an interim service restriction order
were to be made, it would be unlikely to be sufficient to prevent
significant harm arising to individuals in the United Kingdom
as a result of the failure,
and in this section, “the likely failure” means the likely failure
mentioned in section 146(3)(a) or (4)(a) (as the case may be).

(g) in the case of an application made without notice having been given to
the non-compliant provider, or to the persons mentioned in paragraph
(d), state why no notice has been given.
(4) The court may make an interim access restriction order imposing requirements
on a person in relation to the relevant service if the court is satisfied—

in relation to the service,
(b) as to the ground in subsection (1)(b)(i) or (ii),
(c) that the person provides an access facility in relation to the relevant
service,
(d) that there are prima facie grounds to suggest that an application for an
access restriction order under section 147 would be successful,
(e) that the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom
relating to the likely failure, and the nature and severity of that harm,
are such that it is not appropriate to wait for the failure to be established
before making the order, and

provider, or to the persons on whom requirements are being imposed,
that it is appropriate to make the order without notice.

(2) A person “sends a message” if the person—
(a) sends, transmits or publishes a communication (including an oral
communication) by electronic means, or

Act 2006 which authorises the provision of a multiplex service within the
meaning of section 42(6) of that Act.
(12) “On-demand programme service” has the same meaning as in the
Communications Act (see section 368A of that Act), and a person is the

notification of the person’s intention to provide that service in accordance with
section 368BA of that Act.

66D Sharing or threatening to share intimate photograph or film:
interpretation
(1) This section applies for the purposes of sections 66B and 66C.
(2) A person “shares” something if the person, by any means, gives or
shows it to another person or makes it available to another person.
(3) But a provider of an internet service by means of which a photograph
or film is shared is not to be regarded as a person who shares it.
(4) “Photograph” and “film” have the same meaning as in section 66A (see
subsections (3) to (5) of that section).
(5) Except where a photograph or film falls within subsection (8), a
photograph or film “shows, or appears to show, another person in an
intimate state” if it shows or appears to show—
(a) the person participating or engaging in an act which a
reasonable person would consider to be a sexual act,
(b) the person doing a thing which a reasonable person would
consider to be sexual,

(a) a reference to all or part of the person’s genitals, buttocks or
breasts visible through wet or otherwise transparent clothing,

breasts would be exposed but for the fact that they are covered
only with underwear, and
(c) the case where all or part of the person’s genitals, buttocks or
breasts would be exposed but for the fact that they are obscured,
provided that the area obscured is similar to or smaller than an
area that would typically be covered by underwear worn to
cover a person’s genitals, buttocks or breasts (as the case may
be).
(7) In subsection (6)(c) “obscured” means obscured by any means, other
than by clothing that a person is wearing, including, in particular, by an
object, by part of a person’s body or by digital alteration.
(8) A photograph or film falls within this subsection if (so far as it shows
or appears to show a person in an intimate state) it shows or appears to
show something, other than breastfeeding, that is of a kind ordinarily
seen in public.

(a) a system or process operated or used by a provider of a Part 3 service
for the purpose of compliance with relevant requirements,
(b) a risk assessment required to be carried out by Part 3, or
(c) an assessment required to be carried out by section 14,

Part 11 — Supplementary and general
171
(2) Such judgements are to be made on the basis of all relevant information that is
reasonably available to a provider.
(3) In construing the reference to information that is reasonably available to a
provider, the following factors, in particular, are relevant—
(a) the size and capacity of the provider, and
(b) whether a judgement is made by human moderators, by means of
automated systems or processes or by means of automated systems or
processes together with human moderators.
(4) Subsections (5) to (7) apply (as well as subsection (2)) in relation to judgements
by providers about whether content is—
(a) illegal content, or illegal content of a particular kind, or
(b) a fraudulent advertisement.
(5) In making such judgements, the approach to be followed is whether a provider
has reasonable grounds to infer that content is content of the kind in question
(and a provider must treat content as content of the kind in question if
reasonable grounds for that inference exist).
(6) Reasonable grounds for that inference exist in relation to content and an
offence if, following the approach in subsection (2), a provider—
(a) has reasonable grounds to infer that all elements necessary for the
commission of the offence, including mental elements, are present or
satisfied, and
(b) does not have reasonable grounds to infer that a defence to the offence
may be successfully relied upon.
(7) In the case of content generated by a bot or other automated tool, the tests
mentioned in subsection (6)(a) and (b) are to be applied in relation to the
conduct or mental state of a person who may be assumed to control the bot or
tool (or, depending what a provider knows in a particular case, the actual
person who controls the bot or tool).
(8) In considering a provider’s compliance with relevant requirements to which
this section is relevant, OFCOM may take into account whether providers’
judgements follow the approaches set out in this section (including judgements
made by means of automated systems or processes, alone or together with
human moderators).
(9) In this section—
“fraudulent advertisement” has the meaning given by section 38 or 39
(depending on the kind of service in question);
“illegal content” has the same meaning as in Part 3 (see section 59);
“relevant requirements” means—
(a) duties and requirements under this Act, and
(b) requirements of a notice given by OFCOM under this Act.
194 OFCOM’s guidance about illegal content judgements
(1) OFCOM must produce guidance for providers of Part 3 services about the
matters dealt with in section 193 so far as relating to illegal content judgements.
(2) “Illegal content judgements” means—
(a) judgements of a kind mentioned in subsection (4) of that section, and

OFCOM must consult such persons as they consider appropriate.
(4) OFCOM must publish the guidance (and any revised or replacement
guidance).
Time-limits for first guidance
195 Time for publishing first guidance under certain provisions of this Act

(illegal content and fraudulent advertisements).
(3) If OFCOM consider that it is necessary to extend the period mentioned in
subsection (1) in relation to guidance mentioned in any of paragraphs (a) to (i)
of subsection (2), OFCOM may extend the period in relation to that guidance
by up to 12 months by making and publishing a statement.
But this is subject to subsection (6).
(4) A statement under subsection (3) must set out—
(a) the reasons why OFCOM consider that it is necessary to extend the
period mentioned in subsection (1) in relation to the guidance
concerned, and
(b) the period of extension.
(5) A statement under subsection (3) may be published at the same time as (or
incorporate) a statement under section 43(12) (extension of time to prepare
certain codes of practice).
(6) But a statement under subsection (3) may not be made in relation to guidance
mentioned in a particular paragraph of subsection (2) if—

Application of Part 1 and paragraph 6
19 (1) This paragraph applies in relation to—
(a) an illegal content risk assessment or a CAA of the regulated service
if an assessment of that kind is due to be carried out in relation to the
Part 4B part of the service in accordance with paragraph 16 or 17;
(b) a section 15(2) assessment of the regulated service if a section 15(2)
assessment is due to be carried out in relation to the Part 4B part of
the service in accordance with paragraph 18.
References in the rest of this paragraph to an illegal content risk assessment,
a CAA or a section 15(2) assessment are to an assessment of that kind to
which this paragraph applies.
(2) For the purposes of this paragraph—
(a) the regulated service is “type 1” if it would still be a regulated userto-user service even if the Part 4B part were to be assumed not to be
part of the service;
(b) the regulated service is “type 2” if it would be a regulated search
service if the Part 4B part were to be assumed not to be part of the
service;
(c) the regulated service is “type 3” if it does not fall within paragraph
(a) or (b).
(3) If the regulated service is type 1, an illegal content risk assessment, a CAA
or a section 15(2) assessment is to be treated as being due at the time
provided for by Part 1 or paragraph 6 only in relation to the rest of the
service.
(4) In sub-paragraph (3) “the rest of the service” means any user-to-user part of
the regulated service other than the Part 4B part.
(5) If the regulated service is type 2—
(a) an illegal content risk assessment is not required to be carried out at
the time provided for by Part 1, but that is not to be taken to prevent
an illegal content risk assessment as defined by section 26 from being
due in relation to the search engine of the service at the time
provided for by Part 1;
(b) a CAA is to be treated as being due at the time provided for by Part
1 only in relation to the search engine of the service;
(c) a section 15(2) assessment is not required to be carried out at the time

(2) The definition of “the relevant day” is to operate by reference to the CAA
that was (or was required to be) carried out, and accordingly, references to
the day on which the service is to be treated as likely to be accessed by
children are to be read as references to the day on which the Part 4B part of
the service, the rest of the service or the search engine of the service (as the
case may be) is to be treated as likely to be accessed by children.
(3) References to a children’s risk assessment of the service are to a children’s

CODES OF PRACTICE UNDER SECTION 41: PRINCIPLES, OBJECTIVES, CONTENT
General principles
1 In preparing a draft of a code of practice or amendments of a code of
practice, OFCOM must—
(a) consider the appropriateness of provisions of the code of practice to
different kinds and sizes of Part 3 services and to providers of
differing sizes and capacities, and
(b) have regard to the principles mentioned in paragraph 2.
2 The principles are as follows—
(a) providers of Part 3 services must be able to understand which
provisions of the code of practice apply in relation to a particular
service they provide;
(b) the measures described in the code of practice must be sufficiently
clear, and at a sufficiently detailed level, that providers understand
what those measures entail in practice;
(c) the measures described in the code of practice must be proportionate
and technically feasible: measures that are proportionate or
technically feasible for providers of a certain size or capacity, or for
services of a certain kind or size, may not be proportionate or
technically feasible for providers of a different size or capacity or for
services of a different kind or size;

(d) the measures described in the code of practice that apply in relation
to Part 3 services of various kinds and sizes must be proportionate to
OFCOM’s assessment (under section 99) of the risk of harm
presented by services of that kind or size.
Online safety objectives
3 OFCOM must ensure that measures described in codes of practice are
compatible with pursuit of the online safety objectives.
4 The online safety objectives for regulated user-to-user services are as
follows—
(a) a service should be designed and operated in such a way that—
(i) the systems and processes for regulatory compliance and risk
management are effective and proportionate to the kind and
size of service,
(ii) the systems and processes are appropriate to deal with the
number of users of the service and its user base,
(iii) United Kingdom users (including children) are made aware
of, and can understand, the terms of service,
(iv) there are adequate systems and processes to support United
Kingdom users,
(v) (in the case of a Category 1 service) users are offered options
to increase their control over the content they encounter and
the users they interact with,
(vi) the service provides a higher standard of protection for
children than for adults,
(vii) the different needs of children at different ages are taken into
account,
(viii) there are adequate controls over access to the service by
adults, and
(ix) there are adequate controls over access to, and use of, the
service by children, taking into account use of the service by,
and impact on, children in different age groups;
(b) a service should be designed and operated so as to protect
individuals in the United Kingdom who are users of the service from
harm, including with regard to—
(i) algorithms used by the service,
(ii) functionalities of the service, and
(iii) other features relating to the operation of the service.
5 The online safety objectives for regulated search services are as follows—
(a) a service should be designed and operated in such a way that—
(i) the systems and processes for regulatory compliance and risk
management are effective and proportionate to the kind and
size of service,
(ii) the systems and processes are appropriate to deal with the
number of users of the service and its user base,
(iii) United Kingdom users (including children) are made aware
of, and can understand, the publicly available statement
referred to in sections 27 and 29,
(iv) there are adequate systems and processes to support United
Kingdom users,

(v) the service provides a higher standard of protection for
children than for adults, and
(vi) the different needs of children at different ages are taken into
account;
(b) a service should be assessed to understand its use by, and impact on,
children in different age groups;
(c) a search engine should be designed and operated so as to protect
individuals in the United Kingdom who are users of the service from
harm, including with regard to—
(i) algorithms used by the search engine,
(ii) functionalities relating to searches (such as a predictive
search functionality), and
(iii) the indexing, organisation and presentation of search results.
6 In the case of a combined service—
(a) the online safety objectives set out in paragraph 4 do not apply in
relation to the search engine;
(b) the online safety objectives set out in paragraph 5 apply in relation to
the search engine, and accordingly references in that paragraph to a
search service are to be read as references to the search engine;
(c) the reference in paragraph 5(a)(iii) to a publicly available statement
includes a reference to provisions of the terms of service which relate
to the search engine.
7 The Secretary of State may by regulations amend paragraph 4 or 5 so as to
vary the online safety objectives for regulated user-to-user services or
regulated search services, and such regulations may make consequential
amendments of paragraph 6.
8 If regulations are made amending the online safety objectives, OFCOM
must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the regulations come into force,
consider whether a review of the codes of practice published under section
46 is required and, if OFCOM consider that it is required, carry out a review
to assess whether any amendments are needed to reflect the revised
objectives.
Content of codes of practice
9 (1) Codes of practice that describe measures recommended for the purpose of
compliance with a duty set out in section 10(2) or (3) (illegal content) must
include measures in each of the areas of a service listed in section 10(4).
(2) Codes of practice that describe measures recommended for the purpose of
compliance with a duty set out in section 12(2) or (3) (children’s online
safety) must include measures in each of the areas of a service listed in

232
(5) Sub-paragraphs (1) to (4) apply to the extent that inclusion of the measures
in question is consistent with paragraph 1(a) and the principles mentioned
in paragraph 2(c) and (d).
10 (1) Measures described in a code of practice which are recommended for the
purpose of compliance with any of the relevant duties must be designed in
the light of the principles mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) and (where
appropriate) incorporate safeguards for the protection of the matters
mentioned in those principles.
(2) The principles are—
(a) the importance of protecting the right of users and (in the case of
search services or combined services) interested persons to freedom
of expression within the law, and
(b) the importance of protecting the privacy of users.
(3) In sub-paragraph (2)(b) the reference to protecting the privacy of users is to
protecting users from a breach of any statutory provision or rule of law
concerning privacy that is relevant to the use or operation of a user-to-user
service or a search service (including, but not limited to, any such provision
or rule concerning the processing of personal data).
(4) In this paragraph “the relevant duties” means the duties set out in—
(a) sections 10 and 27 (illegal content),
(b) sections 12 and 29 (children’s online safety),
(c) section 15 (user empowerment),
(d) section 17 (content of democratic importance),
(e) section 19 (journalistic content),
(f) sections 20 and 31 (content reporting),
(g) sections 21 and 32 (complaints procedures), and

11 Measures described in a code of practice may relate only to the design or
operation of a Part 3 service—
(a) in the United Kingdom, or
(b) as it affects United Kingdom users of the service.
Content of codes of practice: age assurance
12 (1) This paragraph is about the inclusion of age assurance in a code of practice
as a measure recommended for the purpose of compliance with any of the
duties set out in section 12(2) or (3) or 29(2) or (3), and sub-paragraph (2) sets
out some further principles, in addition to those in paragraphs 1 and 2
(general principles) and 10(2) (freedom of expression and privacy), which
are particularly relevant.
(2) In deciding whether to recommend the use of age assurance, or which kinds
of age assurance to recommend, OFCOM must have regard to the
following—
(a) the principle that age assurance should be effective at correctly
identifying the age or age-range of users;

under section 123 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (age-appropriate
design code);
(c) the need to strike the right balance between—

Schedule 4 — Codes of practice under section 41: principles, objectives, content
233
(i) the levels of risk and the nature, and severity, of potential
harm to children which the age assurance is designed to
guard against, and
(ii) protecting the right of users and (in the case of search services
or the search engine of combined services) interested persons
to freedom of expression within the law;
(d) the principle that more effective kinds of age assurance should be
used to deal with higher levels of risk of harm to children;
(e) the principle that age assurance should be easy to use, including by
children of different ages and with different needs;
(f) the principle that age assurance should work effectively for all users
regardless of their characteristics or whether they are members of a
certain group;
(g) the principle of interoperability between different kinds of age
assurance.
(3) In a code of practice that describes measures for the purpose of compliance
with the duty set out in section 12(3)(a), OFCOM must recommend (among
other things) age verification or age estimation which is such of a kind, and
which is to be used in such a way, that it is highly effective at correctly
determining whether or not a particular user is a child (see section 12(6)).
(4) In deciding which kinds and uses of age verification or age estimation to
recommend for the purpose of compliance with the duty set out in section
12(3)(a), OFCOM must have regard to their guidance under section 83 that
gives examples of kinds and uses of age verification and age estimation that
are, or are not, highly effective at correctly determining whether or not a
particular user is a child.
(5) Nothing in sub-paragraph (2) is to be read as allowing OFCOM to
recommend, for the purpose of compliance with the duty set out in section
12(3)(a) by providers subject to the requirement in section 12(4), a kind or
use of age verification or age estimation which does not meet the
requirement to be highly effective as mentioned in section 12(6).
(6) A code of practice that recommends the use of age assurance for the purpose
of compliance with the duties set out in section 12(2) or (3) must also
describe measures recommended for the purpose of compliance with the
duties set out in—
(a) section 12(9), (11) and (13) (inclusion of clear information in terms of
service), and
(b) section 21(2) and (3) (see, in particular, section 21(5)(e) (complaints
about age assurance)).
(7) A code of practice that recommends the use of age assurance for the purpose
of compliance with the duties set out in section 29(2) or (3) must also
describe measures recommended for the purpose of compliance with the
duties set out in—
(a) section 29(5) and (8) (inclusion of clear information in publicly
available statement), and
(b) section 32(2) and (3) (see, in particular, section 32(5)(d) (complaints
about age assurance)).
(8) A code of practice may—

Schedule 4 — Codes of practice under section 41: principles, objectives, content
234
(a) refer to industry or technical standards for age assurance (where
they exist);
(b) elaborate on the principles mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (c) to (g)
of sub-paragraph (2).
(9) In this paragraph “age assurance” means age verification or age estimation,
and see in particular section 231(4) (self-declaration of age not to be regarded
as age verification or age estimation).
Content of codes of practice: proactive technology
13 (1) If OFCOM consider it appropriate to do so, and in accordance with the
principles to which they must have regard (see paragraphs 1 and 2 and, in
particular, 10(2)), they may include in a code of practice a measure
describing the use of a kind of technology.
(2) But there are constraints, set out in the rest of this paragraph, on OFCOM’s
power to include in a code of practice a measure describing the use of
proactive technology as a way (or one of the ways) of complying with a duty
set out in this Act (a “proactive technology measure”).
(3) A proactive technology measure may be recommended only for the purpose
of compliance with any of the duties set out in—
(a) section 10(2) or (3) (illegal content),
(b) section 12(2) or (3) (children’s online safety),
(c) section 27(2) or (3) (illegal content),
(d) section 29(2) or (3) (children’s online safety), or
(e) section 38(1) or 39(1) (fraudulent advertising).
(4) A proactive technology measure may relate to the use of a kind of
technology on or in relation to any Part 3 service or any part of such a
service, but if the technology operates (or may operate) by analysing usergenerated content or metadata relating to such content, the measure may not
recommend the use of the technology to analyse user-generated content
communicated privately, or metadata relating to user-generated content
communicated privately.
(5) A proactive technology measure may be included in a code of practice in
relation to Part 3 services of a particular kind or size only if OFCOM are
satisfied that use of the technology in question by such services would be
proportionate to the risk of harm that the measure is designed to safeguard
against (taking into account, in particular, the risk profile for the time being
published by OFCOM under section 99 relating to such services).
(6) In deciding whether to include a proactive technology measure in a code of
practice, OFCOM must have regard to the degree of accuracy, effectiveness
and lack of bias achieved by the technology in question, and may—
(a) refer in the code of practice to industry or technical standards for the
technology (where they exist);
(b) set out principles in the code of practice designed to ensure that the
technology or its use is (so far as possible) accurate, effective and free
of bias.
(7) Sub-paragraph (6) does not apply in relation to proactive technology which
is a kind of age verification or age estimation technology.

entities are jointly and severally liable.
(3) In this paragraph “penalty notice” means a penalty notice under section 140,

of the penalty for which the person is liable is £18 million.
(3) The maximum amount of a penalty for which a person not within subparagraph (1) is liable is £18 million.

given) is a group undertaking in relation to entity E.
(4) In sub-paragraph (3)(b), the reference to the qualifying worldwide revenue
of a group of entities is to—

most recent complete accounting period of the entities liable for the
penalty, or

not yet ended, the amount that OFCOM estimate to be the group’s
likely qualifying worldwide revenue for that period.

are different—
(a) the reference in sub-paragraph (4)(a) to the accounting period of the
entities is to be read as a reference to the accounting period of any of
the entities (at OFCOM’s discretion), and
(b) sub-paragraph (4)(b) is to apply as if—
(i) for “the first accounting period of the entities” there were
substituted “the first accounting period of all of the entities”,

(b) section 85 (payment of fees);
(c) Schedule 10 (additional fees).
15 In this Part “relevant regulated service” means—
(a) a regulated user-to-user service which is a pre-existing Part 4B
service within the definition in paragraph (a) of paragraph 1(1), or
(b) a regulated user-to-user service which includes a pre-existing Part 4B
service within the definition in paragraph (b) of paragraph 1(1).
Application of section 84
16 (1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies in relation to a person who is the provider of a
relevant regulated service, whether or not the person is the provider of any
other regulated service.
(2) Section 84, which makes provision about the notification of OFCOM in
relation to a charging year, applies to the provider in relation to every
charging year, regardless of whether any part, or all, of a charging year falls
within the transitional period.
17 (1) This paragraph applies in relation to a person who is the provider of a
relevant regulated service, unless the person is an exempt provider (see
paragraph 24).
(2) Sub-paragraph (3) applies in relation to the provider if—
(a) the provider is required by section 84 to give details to OFCOM of
the provider’s qualifying worldwide revenue for the qualifying
period that relates to a charging year,
(b) the provider gives such details in relation to that charging year at a
time within the transitional period, and
(c) no regulations under section 241(1) have been made before that time
specifying that section 211 is to come into force on or before the first
day of that charging year.
(3) The provider’s notification under section 84 about qualifying worldwide
revenue must include a breakdown indicating the amounts which are
wholly referable to a relevant Part 4B service (if any).
Application of section 85: transitional charging year
18 If a person who is the provider of a relevant regulated service is an exempt
provider, section 85 and Schedule 10 do not apply in relation to the provider
in respect of a transitional charging year (see paragraph 23).
19 (1) If a person who is the provider of a relevant regulated service is not an
exempt provider, section 85 and Schedule 10 apply in relation to the
provider in respect of a transitional charging year.
(2) But sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) apply in relation to the provider in respect of
a transitional charging year if the provider’s notification under section 84 in
relation to that charging year has included details of amounts wholly
referable to a relevant Part 4B service (as mentioned in paragraph 17(3)).
(3) For the purposes of the computation of the provider’s fee under section 85
in respect of the transitional charging year, references in that section to the
provider’s qualifying worldwide revenue are to be taken to be references to
the provider’s non-Part 4B qualifying worldwide revenue.

(4) OFCOM may not require the provider to pay a fee under section 85 in
respect of the transitional charging year if the provider’s non-Part 4B
qualifying worldwide revenue for the qualifying period that relates to that
charging year is less than the threshold figure that has effect for that
charging year.
(5) The amount of a provider’s “non-Part 4B qualifying worldwide revenue” is
the amount that would be the provider’s qualifying worldwide revenue (see
section 86) if all amounts wholly referable to a relevant Part 4B service were
left out of account.
Application of section 85: non-transitional charging year
20 (1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies in relation to a person who is the provider of a
relevant regulated service, whether or not the person is the provider of any
other regulated service.
(2) Section 85 and Schedule 10 apply without modification in relation to the
provider in respect of a non-transitional charging year (even if the
notification date in relation to such a charging year fell within the
transitional period).
Amounts wholly referable to relevant Part 4B service
21 (1) For the purposes of this Part, OFCOM may produce a statement giving
information about the circumstances in which amounts do, or do not, count
as being wholly referable to a relevant Part 4B service.
(2) If OFCOM produce such a statement, they must publish it (and any revised
or replacement statement).

“non-transitional charging year” means a charging year which is not a
transitional charging year;

year is required to be given (see section 84(5));

(a) a regulated user-to-user service described in paragraph 15(a),
or
(b) a pre-existing Part 4B service included in a regulated user-touser service described in paragraph 15(b).

if—
(a) the notification date in relation to that charging year fell within the
transitional period, and
(b) no regulations under section 241(1) were made before the
notification date specifying that section 211 was to come into force on
