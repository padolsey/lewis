Make provision for and in connection with the removal from the United

provision about unaccompanied children; to make provision about victims of
slavery or human trafficking; to make provision about leave to enter or remain

B E IT ENACTED by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and
consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present
Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—
Introduction
1 Introduction
(1) The purpose of this Act is to prevent and deter unlawful migration, and in
5
particular migration by unsafe and illegal routes, by requiring the removal
from the United Kingdom of certain persons who enter or arrive in the United
Kingdom in breach of immigration control.
(2) To advance that purpose, this Act—
(a) places a duty on the Secretary of State to make arrangements for the
10
removal of certain persons who enter or arrive in the United Kingdom
in breach of immigration control as soon as is reasonably practicable
after their entry or arrival, subject only to the exceptions specified by
or under this Act;
(b) provides for protection claims and certain human rights claims made
15
by persons who meet the conditions for removal under this Act to be
inadmissible;
(c) provides for the detention of persons who are subject to removal under
this Act;
HL Bill 148 58/3
Illegal Migration Bill 1 
(d) provides for protections and entitlements to assistance and support
which are available to victims of modern slavery or human trafficking
not to apply to persons who are subject to removal under this Act;
(e)
5
prevents persons who meet the conditions for removal under this Act
from being given leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom;
(f) prevents persons who meet the conditions for removal under this Act
from settling in the United Kingdom or obtaining citizenship;
(g) provides a procedure for persons who are subject to removal under
10
this Act to challenge their removal by means of a suspensive claim
(as defined in section 37);
(h) has the effect that all other legal challenges to the removal of persons
under this Act do not suspend the duty to make arrangements for
their removal.
(3)
15
Accordingly, and so far as it is possible to do so, provision made by or by
virtue of this Act must be read and given effect so as to achieve the purpose
mentioned in subsection (1).
(4) In addition, this Act makes provision—
(a) about the period for which persons may be detained in immigration
detention;
(b) for protections that apply to victims of modern slavery or human 20
trafficking not to apply to persons who are a threat to public order
or who have claimed to be victims in bad faith unless compelling
circumstances apply;
(c)
25
for persons who have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment for
an offence or who are liable to deportation to be deemed to be a threat
to public order for the purposes of the disapplication of those
protections;
(d) for asylum claims and human rights claims made by nationals of
certain safe States to be inadmissible;
(e) for the maximum number of persons who may enter the United 30
Kingdom annually using safe and legal routes to be specified in
regulations which are subject to approval by Parliament;
(f) for certain kinds of behaviour relating to an identity document or
35
electronic information by a person who makes an asylum claim or a
human rights claim to be taken into account as damaging the
claimant’s credibility.
(5) Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (interpretation of legislation) does
not apply in relation to provision made by or by virtue of this Act.

opinion.
(5) For the purposes of subsection (4) a person is not to be taken to have come

4 Disregard of certain claims, applications etc

(3) A protection claim or a human rights claim declared inadmissible under 15
subsection (2) cannot be considered under the immigration rules.

rights claim) arises.

of a person from the United Kingdom to—

A “serious harm suspensive claim” means a claim by a person (“P”) who has
been given a third country removal notice that the serious harm condition is
met in relation to P.

irreversible harm for the purposes of this Act.

irreversible harm.

40 Relationship with other proceedings
(1)
15
A “serious harm suspensive claim” made under this Act is not a “human
rights claim” for the purposes of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
Act 2002 or the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.
(2) Accordingly no right of appeal under section 82(1)(a) or (b) of the Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (appeal against refusal of protection claim
20
or human rights claim) arises in relation to any decision of the Secretary of
State made under section 41 (serious harm suspensive claims), 45 (out of time
claims) or 47 (new matters) of this Act in respect of a serious harm suspensive
claim.
(3) The making of a serious harm suspensive claim by a person (or the possibility
25
of a person making such a claim) does not affect any ability of the person to
make a human rights claim in relation to their removal from the United
Kingdom to a third country under this Act.
(4) Where—
(a) a person subject to removal to a third country under this Act makes
30
a human rights claim in relation to their removal to that third country,
and
(b) the Secretary of State decides to refuse the claim,
there is no right of appeal under section 82(1)(a) or (b) of the Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 in relation to that decision.
(5)
35
Subsection (4) does not affect any ability of the person to make an application
for judicial review in relation to a decision of the Secretary of State to refuse
the claim (but section 4(1)(d) (disregard of application for judicial review)
applies in relation to any such application).
(6) In section 82(3) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, after
40
”Part” insert “and in section 40(4) of the Illegal Migration Act 2023 (relationship
with other proceedings)”.
