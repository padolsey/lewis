The proposed bill contains significant changes to rental housing laws in the UK that could substantially impact tenants, landlords, local authorities, and the broader housing market. Key areas needing scrutiny include the effects on tenant protections and welfare, obligations and costs imposed on landlords, impacts on housing availability and homelessness services, establishment of a rental property database and associated privacy and legal concerns, and added responsibilities for local councils and the justice system.
