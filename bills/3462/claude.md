The Renters (Reform) Bill aims to overhaul and improve the rights of tenants renting homes in England and Wales. Some of the main changes proposed include:

 * Abolishing 'no fault' evictions by getting rid of fixed term tenancies and Assured Shorthold Tenancies. This would give tenants greater security and prevent evictions without good reason.
 * Amending the grounds under which landlords can evict tenants, making it harder to evict without good cause. New grounds are also added, like allowing eviction for repeated late rental payments.
 * Extending tenancy deposit protection to cover all tenancies, not just Assured Shorthold Tenancies. The bill also amends rules so a court can only order possession if the deposit is protected and other requirements are met.
 * Requiring the return of the deposit before a section 21 eviction notice can be valid. Allowing tenants to pay the deposit directly to the scheme.
 * Giving tenants the right to request a pet and placing requirements on landlords to reasonably consider.
 * Establishing a landlord redress scheme that tenants can use to complain and get determinations on landlord disputes. Requires landlord membership.
 * Allowing local authorities stronger enforcement powers against landlords, including fines for breaches. Also establishes a lead enforcement authority.
 * Creating a national landlord and property database to support enforcement of landlord duties and the redress scheme.
 * Requiring landlords to provide tenants a written statement of rental terms and their rights and responsibilities.
 * Limiting how much and how frequently rents can be increased, with a new procedure tenants can use to challenge unjustified increases.

Overall the bill aims to reshape the private rental sector to be more regulated, with the goal of achieving more balance between tenant and landlord rights and protections. But it remains controversial given the sweeping changes proposed.
