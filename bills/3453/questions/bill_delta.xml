   <quote>(1) The CMA may accept an appropriate commitment from a designated undertaking as to its conduct in respect of an adverse effect on competition or a detrimental effect on UK users or UK customers that the CMA considers has resulted, or may be expected to result, from an adverse effect on competition.</quote>
   <quote>(2) A commitment is appropriate where the CMA considers that compliance with the commitment by the undertaking would contribute to or otherwise be of use in remedying, mitigating or preventing—
(a) the adverse effect on competition, or
(b) the detrimental effect on UK users or UK customers.</quote>
   <quote>(3) Following the acceptance of a commitment by the CMA as to the conduct of an undertaking—
(a) the undertaking that gave the commitment must comply with it at all times when it is in force, and
(b) so far as relating to the conduct, the CMA may give a notice to the undertaking—
(i) ending a PCI investigation (if it has begun one) without making a PCI decision, or
(ii) changing the scope of a PCI investigation.</quote>
   <quote>(4) As soon as reasonably practicable after giving a notice under subsection (3)(b), the CMA must publish a statement summarising the contents of the notice.</quote>

   <summary>The proposed change allows the CMA to accept commitments from designated undertakings regarding their conduct to address adverse effects on competition or detrimental effects on UK users or customers. The undertaking must comply with the commitment, and the CMA may give a notice to end or change the scope of a PCI investigation based on the commitment. The CMA is also required to publish a statement summarizing the contents of the notice.</summary>

   <quote>(5) The acceptance of a commitment does not prevent—
(a)
15
a PCI investigation from continuing so far as it relates to conduct other
than that to which the commitment relates, or
(b) the CMA beginning a new PCI investigation in relation to the conduct
to which the commitment relates where it has reasonable grounds—
(i) to believe that there has been a material change of
circumstances since the commitment was accepted,
(ii) to suspect that the undertaking has not complied with one or 20
more of the terms of the commitment, or
(iii) to suspect that information which led it to accept the
commitment was incomplete, false or misleading in a material
particular.</quote>

   <summary>The amendment clarifies that the acceptance of a commitment does not prevent a PCI (Prohibited Conduct Investigation) from continuing if it relates to conduct other than that to which the commitment relates. It also allows the CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) to begin a new PCI investigation if there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a material change of circumstances, the undertaking has not complied with the terms of the commitment, or the information that led to the acceptance of the commitment was incomplete, false, or misleading.</summary>

(4) In deciding whether to accept a fast-track reference request under subsection (2) or (3), the CMA must have regard, in particular, to— (a) whether the arrangements concerned raise any consideration specified in section 58; (b) whether a special intervention notice (see section 59(2)) is in force in relation to the arrangements. (5) Where the CMA decides to accept a fast-track reference request the duties to make references under sections 22(1) and 33(1) do not apply, and accordingly the CMA may not make any reference under those provisions in respect of the arrangements concerned (but see the duties under sections 22(1A) and 33(1A)).”</quote>

   <summary>The amendment inserts a new Schedule 5 into EA 2002, which introduces provisions for fast-track references under sections 22 and 33. It specifies the duties of the CMA to make references in relation to completed and anticipated mergers, sets time-limits for decisions about references, and outlines the procedure for fast-track reference requests. It also provides criteria for the acceptance of fast-track reference requests by the CMA.</summary>

3 Displaying a trust mark, quality mark or equivalent without having obtained
the necessary authorisation.

(b) the terms of the approval, endorsement or authorisation have not
been, or are not being, complied with.
5 (1) Making an invitation to purchase products at a specified price where—
(a)
15
the trader has reasonable grounds for believing that it will not be
possible for the trader to offer those products, or equivalent
products, for supply at that price, in reasonable quantities, for a
reasonable period of time (or to procure another trader to do so),
and
(b) the trader does not disclose that fact.
(2) In sub-paragraph (1), the references to reasonable quantities and a 20
reasonable period of time are references to what is reasonable having regard
to—
(a) the nature of the product,

(c) demonstrating a defective sample of it, 30
with the intention of promoting a different product.
7 Falsely stating that a product will only be available for a limited time, or
that it will only be available on particular terms for a limited time, in order
35
to elicit an immediate decision and deprive consumers of sufficient
opportunity or time to make an informed choice.
8 Undertaking to provide an after-sales service to consumers and then making
such service available only in a language which is different to the language
used in communication with the consumer for, or prior to, the transaction

sold when it cannot.
11 Presenting rights given to consumers by law as a distinctive feature of the

the risk to the personal security or safety of the consumer, a member of
the consumer’s family or anyone living in the consumer’s home, if the

(2)
20
In sub-paragraph (1), a pyramid promotional scheme means a scheme

of products.
16

prizes described or a reasonable equivalent.
21
40
Creating the false impression that the consumer has already won, will win,
or will on doing a particular act win, a prize or other equivalent benefit,
when in fact either—
(a) there is no prize or other equivalent benefit, or
(b) taking any action in relation to claiming the prize or other equivalent
benefit requires the consumer to pay money or incur a cost.
22 Describing a product as “gratis”, “free”, “without charge” or similar if the
5
consumer has to pay anything other than the unavoidable cost of responding
to the commercial practice and collecting or paying for delivery of the item.

payment which gives the consumer the impression that the consumer has
already ordered the marketed product when the consumer has not.
24
10
Falsely claiming or creating the false impression that the trader is not acting
for purposes relating to the trader’s business or falsely representing oneself
as a consumer.
25 Creating the impression that the consumer cannot leave the premises until
a contract is formed.
26
15
Ignoring a request from a consumer to leave or not return to the consumer’s
home except in circumstances and to the extent justified to enforce a
contractual obligation.

attending at the consumer’s home, except in circumstances and to the extent
justified to enforce a contractual obligation.
28 Requiring a consumer who wishes to claim on an insurance policy to 20
produce documents which could not reasonably be considered relevant as
to whether the claim was valid, or failing systematically to respond to
correspondence, in order to dissuade a consumer from exercising the
consumer’s contractual rights.
29 Including in an advertisement a direct appeal to children to buy advertised 25
products or persuade their parents or other adults to buy advertised
products for them.
