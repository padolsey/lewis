5 Substantial and entrenched market power 20
In order to assess whether an undertaking has substantial and entrenched
market power in respect of a digital activity for the purposes of section 2(2)(a),
the CMA must carry out a forward-looking assessment of a period of at least
5 years, taking into account developments that—
(a) would be expected or foreseeable if the CMA did not designate the 25

(b) may affect the undertaking’s conduct in carrying out the digital
activity.

(b) a significant number of other undertakings use the digital activity as 35
carried out by the undertaking in carrying on their business;

it to extend its market power to a range of other activities;
(d)
40
the undertaking’s position in respect of the digital activity allows it
to determine or substantially influence the ways in which other
Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill 3

undertaking is part of a group, the global turnover of that group in
the relevant period exceeds £25 billion, or
(b) the total value of the UK turnover of an undertaking or, where the 15
undertaking is part of a group, the UK turnover of that group in the
relevant period exceeds £1 billion.
(3) The Secretary of State may by regulations amend either of the sums mentioned
in subsection (2).
(4) Regulations under subsection (3) are subject to the affirmative procedure. 20
(5) The CMA must—
(a) keep under review the sums mentioned in subsection (2), and
(b) from time to time advise the Secretary of State as to whether the sums
are still appropriate.
(6) In this section— 25
(a) the “relevant period” means—
(i) the most recent period of 12 months (“period A”) in respect of
which the CMA considers that it is able to make an estimate
30
of the total value of the relevant turnover of the undertaking
or group, or
(ii) if the CMA estimates that the relevant turnover of the
undertaking or group in the period of 12 months ending
immediately before period A was higher than the relevant
35
turnover of the undertaking or group in period A, that earlier
period of 12 months;

of a designated undertaking in respect of a relevant digital activity not later
than 9 months before the end of the designation period relating to that

Commitments relating to conduct requirements
36 Commitments
(1)
15
The CMA may accept an appropriate commitment from an undertaking subject
to a conduct investigation as to its behaviour in respect of a conduct
requirement to which the investigation relates.
(2) A commitment is appropriate where the CMA considers that compliance with
the commitment by the undertaking would mean that it would not be
20
necessary to carry out a conduct investigation so far as relating to the
behaviour to which the commitment relates.
(3) Following the acceptance of a commitment by the CMA as to the behaviour
of an undertaking—
(a) the undertaking that gave the commitment must comply with it at all
times when it is in force, and
(b) so far as relating to the behaviour, the CMA may not give a notice to 25
the undertaking under section 30 (notice of findings).
(4) The acceptance of a commitment does not prevent—
(a) a conduct investigation from continuing so far as it relates to other
30
behaviour in relation to the same or a different conduct requirement,
or
(b) the CMA beginning a new conduct investigation in relation to the
behaviour to which the commitment relates where—
(i) it has reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a
35
material change of circumstances since the commitment was
accepted,
(ii) it has reasonable grounds to suspect that the undertaking has
not complied with one or more of the terms of the commitment,
or
(iii)
40
it has reasonable grounds to suspect that information which
led it to accept the commitment was incomplete, false or
misleading in a material particular.

of any functions in relation to a breach or possible breach of that commitment.
(9) Schedule 1 makes provision about— 15
(a) accepting, or accepting a variation of, a commitment, and

35
has resulted, or may be expected to result, from an adverse effect on
competition.

SCHEDULE 15 Section 201
INVESTIGATORY POWERS
Introductory
1 Schedule 5 to CRA 2015 (investigatory powers) is amended as follows.
Penalties for non-compliance with information notices 5
2 (1) Paragraph 15 is amended in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) and (3).

“Non-compliance with notice under paragraph 14: power of court to impose
monetary penalties
16A (1) This paragraph applies where—
(a) an enforcer or an officer of an enforcer has given a notice
to a person (“the respondent”) under paragraph 14, and
(b)
20
the enforcer considers that the respondent has, without
reasonable excuse, failed to comply with the notice.
(2) The enforcer or an officer of the enforcer may make an application
under this paragraph to the court.
(3) If the court finds that the respondent has, without reasonable
25
excuse, failed to comply with the notice, the court may make an
order that requires the respondent to pay a monetary penalty to
the enforcer.
(4) The amount of the penalty must be—
(a) a fixed amount,
(b) an amount calculated by reference to a daily rate, or
(c) a combination of a fixed amount and an amount calculated 30
by reference to a daily rate.
(5) The penalty must not exceed—
(a) in the case of a fixed amount, £30,000 or, if higher, 1% of
the total value of the turnover (if any) of the respondent;
(b) in the case of an amount calculated by reference to a daily 35
rate, £15,000 per day or, if higher, 5% of the total value
of the daily turnover (if any) of the respondent;
318 Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill
Schedule 15—Investigatory powers 
(c) in the case of a fixed amount and an amount calculated
by reference to a daily rate, such fixed amount and such
amount per day.
(6) In imposing a penalty by reference to a daily rate—
(a) no account is to be taken of any days before the 5
notification date, and
(b) unless the court determines an earlier date (whether before
or after the order imposing the penalty is made), the
10
amount payable ceases to accumulate on the day on which
the requirements of the notice under paragraph 14 are
complied with.
(7) An order under this paragraph must state—
(a) the amount of the penalty (including whether it is a fixed
15
amount, an amount calculated by reference to a daily rate
or both a fixed amount and an amount calculated by
reference to a daily rate);
(b) the grounds on which the penalty is imposed together
with any other factors that the court considers justify the
giving of the penalty or its amount;
(c) in the case of an amount calculated by reference to a daily 20
rate, the day on which the amount first starts to
accumulate and the day or days on which it might cease
to accumulate;
(d) how the penalty is to be paid to the enforcer;
(e) the date or dates, no earlier than the end of 28 days 25
beginning with the date of service of the order on the
respondent, by which the penalty or (as the case may be)
different portions of it are required to be paid;
(f)
30
that the penalty or (as the case may be) different portions
of it may be paid earlier than the date or dates by which
it or they are required to be paid;
(g) that the respondent has the right to apply under
sub-paragraph (8), or to appeal against the order, and the
main details of those rights.
(8) The respondent may, within 14 days of the notification date, 35
apply to the court for it to specify a different date or dates by
which the penalty, or portions of it, are to be paid.
(9) An application by an enforcer or officer of an enforcer under this
paragraph—
(a) may be made in addition to, or instead of, an application 40
under paragraph 16, and
(b) where made in addition to an application under paragraph
16, may be combined with the application under that
paragraph.
Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill 319
Schedule 15—Investigatory powers 
(10) In addition to any right of appeal on a point of law, a person
liable to pay a penalty by virtue of an order under this paragraph
may appeal in respect of the amount of the penalty.
(11)
5
Where an appeal is brought in respect of a penalty imposed by
virtue of an order under this paragraph, the penalty is not payable
until the appeal is determined or withdrawn, unless the court
dealing with the appeal orders otherwise.
(12) Sub-paragraphs (4) and (5) of paragraph 16 apply to an order
10
under this paragraph as they apply to an order under that
paragraph.
(13) In this paragraph, other than in sub-paragraph (11)—
“the court” has the same meaning as in paragraph 16;
“the notification date”, in relation to an order under this
15
paragraph, means the date on which notice of the
application for the order is given to the respondent.
Non-compliance with notice under paragraph 14: powers of CMA to give
provisional enforcement notice
16B (1) This paragraph applies where—
(a)
20
the CMA has given a notice to a person (“the respondent”)
under paragraph 14, and
(b) the CMA has reasonable grounds to believe that the
respondent has failed to comply with the notice.
(2) The CMA may give to the respondent a notice under this
paragraph (a “provisional enforcement notice”).
(3) A provisional enforcement notice must— 25
(a) set out the grounds on which it is given, including the
respondent’s acts or omissions giving rise to the giving
of the notice;
(b)
30
specify such actions as the CMA considers appropriate to
be taken by the respondent for the purposes of securing
compliance with the notice under paragraph 14;
(c) invite the respondent to make representations to the CMA
about the matters set out in the notice;
(d)
35
specify the means by which, and the time by which, such
representations must be made.
(4) The means specified under sub-paragraph (3)(d) for making
representations must include arrangements for them to be made
orally if the respondent chooses to make representations in that
way.
(5) If the CMA is considering the imposition of a monetary penalty 40
on the respondent (see paragraph 16C), the provisional
enforcement notice must also state—
320 Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill
Schedule 15—Investigatory powers 
(a) that the CMA is considering imposing a monetary penalty;
(b) the proposed amount of the penalty (including whether
the penalty would be a fixed amount, an amount
5
calculated by reference to a daily rate or both a fixed
amount and an amount calculated by reference to a daily
rate);
(c) any further factors (in addition to those provided under
sub-paragraph (3)(a)) which the CMA considers justify
10
the imposition of the proposed penalty and its amount or
amounts.
Non-compliance with notice under paragraph 14: power of CMA to give final
enforcement notice
16C (1) This paragraph applies where—
(a)
15
the CMA has given to the respondent a provisional
enforcement notice under paragraph 16B in respect of a
notice given to the respondent under paragraph 14,
(b) the time for the respondent to make representations to
the CMA in accordance with the provisional enforcement
notice has expired, and
(c) after considering such representations (if any), the CMA 20
is satisfied that the respondent has failed to comply with
the notice given under paragraph 14.
(2) The CMA may by notice (a “final enforcement notice”) impose
25
on the respondent a requirement to do either or both of the
following—
(a) a requirement to pay a monetary penalty;
(b) a requirement to comply with such directions as the CMA
considers appropriate for the purpose of securing the
30
respondent’s compliance with the notice under paragraph
14.
(3) A requirement under sub-paragraph (2)(a) to pay a monetary
penalty may be imposed only if the CMA is satisfied that the
respondent’s failure in question is without reasonable excuse.
(4) The amount of a monetary penalty must be—
(a) a fixed amount, 35
(b) an amount calculated by reference to a daily rate, or
(c) a combination of a fixed amount and an amount calculated
by reference to a daily rate.
(5) The penalty must not exceed—
(a) in the case of a fixed amount, £30,000 or, if higher, 1% of 40
the total value of the turnover (if any) of the respondent;
Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill 321
Schedule 15—Investigatory powers 
(b) in the case of an amount calculated by reference to a daily
rate, £15,000 per day or, if higher, 5% of the total value
of the daily turnover (if any) of the respondent;
(c)
5
in the case of a fixed amount and an amount calculated
by reference to a daily rate, such fixed amount and such
amount per day.
(6) In imposing a penalty by reference to a daily rate—
(a) no account is to be taken of any days before the date on
10
which the provisional enforcement notice mentioned in
sub-paragraph (1)(a) was given to the respondent, and
(b) unless the CMA determines an earlier date, the amount
payable ceases to accumulate on the day on which the
requirements of the notice under paragraph 14 are
complied with.
(7) A final enforcement notice that imposes a penalty on the 15
respondent must state—
(a) the amount of the penalty (including whether it is a fixed
amount, an amount calculated by reference to a daily rate
20
or both a fixed amount and an amount calculated by
reference to a daily rate);
(b) the grounds on which the penalty is imposed together
with any other factors that the CMA considers justify the
giving of the penalty or its amount;
(c)
25
in the case of an amount calculated by reference to a daily
rate, the day on which the amount first starts to
accumulate and the day or days on which it might cease
to accumulate;
(d) how the penalty is to be paid to the CMA;
(e)
30
the date or dates, no earlier than the end of 28 days
beginning with the date of service of the notice on the
respondent, by which the penalty or (as the case may be)
different portions of it are required to be paid;
(f) that the penalty or (as the case may be) different portions
35
of it may be paid earlier than the date or dates by which
it or they are required to be paid;
(g) that the respondent has the right to apply under
sub-paragraph (8), or to appeal under paragraph 16D, and
the main details of those rights.
(8)
40
The respondent may, within 14 days of the date of service of the
notice, apply to the CMA for it to specify a different date or dates
by which the penalty, or different portions of it, are to be paid.
(9) In deciding whether, and if so how, to proceed under this
paragraph the CMA must have regard to the statement of policy
45
most recently published under paragraph 16F at the time of the
act or omission giving rise to the penalty.
322 Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill
Schedule 15—Investigatory powers 
(10) The CMA may publish a notice given under this paragraph in
such manner as it considers appropriate.
(11) Sections 184 to 189 of the Digital Markets, Competition and
5
Consumers Act 2023 apply to a direction given in a notice under
this paragraph as if the direction were an enforcement direction
for the purposes of those sections.
Appeals against final enforcement notice
16D A person to whom a final enforcement notice is given may appeal
to the appropriate court against—
(1)
(a) a decision to impose a monetary penalty by virtue of the 10
notice,
(b) the nature or amount of any such penalty, or
(c) the giving of directions by virtue of the notice.
(2)

PART 3: TRANSITIONAL AND SAVING PROVISIONS IN RELATION TO PART 3
Interpretation
1 In this Schedule— 25

into force;
“continuing conduct” means an act or omission of a person that—
(a) takes place before the commencement date, and
(b) is repeated, or continues to take place, on or after that date; 30
“enforcement action”—
(a) in relation to the new law, means proceedings or other steps
taken by virtue of a power conferred under the new law,
and
(b) in relation to the old law, means proceedings or other steps 35
taken by virtue of a power conferred under the old law;
“the new law” means Chapters 3 and 4 of Part 3 (and any provisions
of law relating to those Chapters, including Schedule 5 to CRA 2015
as amended by this Act);
338 Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill
Schedule 17—Part 3: transitional and saving provisions in relation to Part 3 
“the old law” means—
(a) Part 8 of EA 2002, as that Part had effect immediately before
the commencement date, and
(b)
5
any provisions of law (including in particular Schedule 5 to
CRA 2015) relating to Part 8 of EA 2002, as those provisions
had effect immediately before the commencement date.
2 (1) The old law continues to apply—
(a) in respect of conduct of a person that takes place before the
commencement date;
(b) for the purposes of the taking of enforcement action relating to a 10
breach of an order made by, or undertaking given to, the court
under the old law;
(c) in a case where proceedings before a court under the old law have
15
been started against a person before the commencement date, for
the purposes of the continuation and completion of those
proceedings (including any appeals relating to the proceedings).
(2) In sub-paragraph (1)(c) the reference to proceedings being started against
a person is a reference to an application being made against the person
under section 215 or 218ZA of EA 2002.
(3) This paragraph is subject to— 20
(a) paragraph 3, which makes rules for cases involving continuing
conduct, and
(b) paragraph 4, which makes rules for cases involving breach of
undertakings given to enforcers.
Rules applicable to continuing conduct 25
3 (1) This paragraph applies where conduct of a person is continuing conduct.
(2) The new law applies in respect of the person’s post-commencement conduct.
(3) The new law also applies in respect of the person’s pre-commencement
30
conduct for the purposes of enabling the taking of enforcement action under
Chapter 3 or 4 of Part 3 in relation to that conduct.
(4) Where the new law applies by virtue of sub-paragraph (3), a requirement
under Chapter 3 or (as the case may be) Chapter 4 may be imposed on a
person in respect of the relevant infringement in relation to which the
35
enforcement action is taken only if a requirement of a corresponding kind
could have been imposed on the person under the old law (and accordingly
a monetary penalty, in particular, may not be imposed on the person).
(5) In applying the new law in accordance with this paragraph in respect of
a person’s post-commencement conduct, regard may be had to, and findings
40
of fact or law may be made in respect of, the person’s pre-commencement
conduct so far as necessary or appropriate for the purposes of determining
any matter that falls to be determined in the application of the new law.
(6) In this paragraph—
Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill 339

“post commencement conduct” means so much of a person’s continuing
conduct as takes place on or after the commencement date;
“pre-commencement conduct” means so much of a person’s continuing
conduct as takes place before the commencement date.

4 This paragraph applies where an enforcer has accepted an undertaking
from a person under the old law.
(1)
(2) Enforcement action in respect of a person’s breach of the undertaking,
10
whether the breach takes place before, on or after the commencement date,
may be taken only under the old law.
(3) Sub-paragraph (4) applies where a breach of the undertaking—
(a) takes place (to any extent) on or after the commencement date, and
(b) it appears to an enforcer that the act or omission comprising the
breach, so far as taking place on or after that date—
(i) is also a commercial practice which constitutes a relevant 15
infringement under the new law, or
(ii) is carried out by a person who is an accessory under the
new law to such a commercial practice.
(4) Enforcement action in respect of the act or omission may be taken—
(a) under the new law, or 20
(b) if the act or omission would also be a domestic or Schedule 13
infringement for the purposes of the old law, under the old law.
(5) It is for the enforcer concerned to determine whether to take enforcement
25
action under the new law or the old law in accordance with sub-paragraph
(4).
(6) A breach of an undertaking that first takes place before the commencement
date is to be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as also taking place
on or after that date if the act or omission comprising the breach is repeated
or continued on or after that date.
Information notices under Schedule 5 to CRA 2015 30
5 The amendments made by paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 15 (which insert

date.
