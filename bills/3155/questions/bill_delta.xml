(1) This section applies if an order under section 104(1) (constitution of combined authority) enables a combined authority to make provision about its constitution (“constitutional provision”).
(2) An appropriate person may carry out a review of the combined authority’s constitutional provision if—
(a) an appropriate person proposes a review, and
(b) the combined authority consents to the review.
(3) If an appropriate person carries out a review under subsection (2), they may propose changes to the combined authority’s constitutional provision as a result of the review for agreement by the authority.
(4) The question of whether to consent under subsection (2)(b) or to agree to changes proposed under subsection (3) is to be decided at a meeting of the combined authority by a simple majority of the voting members of the authority who are present at the meeting.
(5) In the case of a mayoral combined authority—
(a) a majority in favour of consenting under subsection (2)(b) does not need to include the mayor, but
(b) a majority in favour of changes proposed under subsection (3) must include the mayor.
(6) The reference in subsection (4) to a voting member—
(a) includes a substitute member who may act in place of a voting member;
(b) does not include a non-constituent or associate member.
(7) Subsection (4) applies instead of—
(a) any provision of an order under section 104(1) made before the coming into force of this section which is about the procedure applying to a decision on a question of a kind mentioned in subsection (4), and
(b) any constitutional provision of a combined authority about such procedure.
(8) In this section “appropriate person”, in relation to a combined authority, means—
(a) a member of the authority appointed by a county council the whole or any part of whose area is within the area of the authority,
(b) a member of the authority appointed by a district council whose area is within the area of the authority, or
(c) the mayor for the area of the authority (if it is a mayoral combined authority).”</quote>

(b) a person not within paragraph (a) with an interest in the land, 10

(b) that the completion notice deadline is an unreasonable one;
(c) that the notice was not served on the persons on whom it was

notice deadline, or
(c) uphold the notice with the original completion notice deadline.
(6) On an appeal under this section the Secretary of State may also correct

(a) the progress that has been made, and that remains to be made, towards completing the dwellings the creation of which the development is to involve, as at the end of the reporting period to which the report relates,
(b) the progress which is predicted to be made towards completing those dwellings over each subsequent reporting period up to and including the last reporting period, and
(c) such other information as may be prescribed in regulations under subsection (9).

   <quote>(130) Power to designate Homes and Communities Agency as a charging authority
In section 14 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (contents of 30
designation orders), after subsection (6) insert—
“(6A) The order may provide that where the HCA is the local planning
authority for the whole or any part of the designated area it is to be
35
a charging authority under section 204B(3)(b) of the Planning Act 2008
(Infrastructure Levy) for the whole or any part of that area—

(b) in relation to all or specified kinds of development, and
(c) in place of any person or body who would otherwise be the
charging authority for that area, for those purposes, and in
relation to those kinds of development.”</quote>

   <summary>The proposed change allows the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) to be designated as a charging authority under the Planning Act 2008 for the purpose of the Infrastructure Levy. The HCA can be designated as a charging authority for the whole or any part of a designated area, for specified purposes and kinds of development, and in place of any other charging authority.</summary>

   <subject>Definition of "community land auction arrangement"</subject>

   <quote>A “community land auction arrangement” means an arrangement provided
for in CLA regulations under which—
(a) a local planning authority is to invite anyone who has a freehold or
leasehold interest in land in the authority’s area to offer to grant a
CLA option over the land, with a view to the land being allocated for
development in the next local plan for the authority’s area,
(b) any CLA option granted under the arrangement ceases to have effect 20
if the land subject to the option is not so allocated when that plan is
adopted or approved (unless the option has already been exercised
or been withdrawn or otherwise ceased to have effect), and
(c) the local planning authority may—
(i) exercise the CLA option and dispose of the interest in the land 25
to a person who proposes to develop the land,
(ii) exercise the CLA option with a view to developing the land
itself, or
(iii)
30
dispose of the CLA option to a person who proposes to exercise
it and then develop the land.</quote>

   <summary>The bill introduces the concept of a "community land auction arrangement," which is an arrangement provided for in CLA regulations. It involves a local planning authority inviting landowners to offer a CLA option over their land, with the intention of allocating the land for development in the next local plan. The CLA option will cease to have effect if the land is not allocated in the plan, and the local planning authority has the power to exercise the option, dispose of the land, or dispose of the option to another person.</summary>

   <quote>“1ZA Local authority proposal for designation of locally-led new town in
England
(1)
20
A local authority in England, or two or more local authorities in
England acting jointly, may propose to the Secretary of State that the
Secretary of State should designate an area of land (the “proposal
area”) as the site of a proposed new town.
(2) A proposal under subsection (1) (a “locally-led proposal”) must—
(a) state the proposing authority’s proposals as to—
(i) the name of the development corporation that would 25
be established as a result of the proposal, and
(ii) which local authority or local authorities should be
designated as the oversight authority for that
development corporation, and
(b) include a map of the proposal area. 30
(3) A locally-led proposal may also include proposals about any other
matter about which the Secretary of State would be able to make
provision in respect of the development corporation by order or
regulations under this Act.
(4) A local authority may make a locally-led proposal only if— 35
(a) the proposal area falls wholly within the area of the local
authority, or
(b) where it makes the proposal jointly with one or more other
local authorities, the proposal area falls—
(i) wholly or partly within the area of each of them, and
(ii) wholly within their combined areas.
(5) A proposing authority may make a locally-led proposal only if—
(a)
5
the proposing authority has consulted the persons mentioned
in subsection (6);
(b) the proposing authority has had regard to any comments made
in response by the consultees, and
(c) if those comments include comments by a local authority or
10
the Greater London Authority that the proposing authority
does not accept, the proposing authority has published a
statement giving the reasons for the non-acceptance.
(6) The persons referred to in subsection (5)(a) are—
(a) persons who appear to the proposing authority to represent
those living in, or in the vicinity of, the proposal area;
(b) persons who appear to the proposing authority to represent 15
businesses with any premises in, or in the vicinity of, the
proposal area;
(c) each Member of Parliament whose parliamentary constituency
includes any part of the proposal area;
(d) each local authority for an area which falls wholly or partly 20
within the proposal area (other than the proposing authority
or a constituent council of the proposing authority);
(e) in relation to an area in Greater London, the Greater London
Authority;
(f) any other person whom the proposing authority considers it 25
appropriate to consult.
(7) A local authority may be proposed as the oversight authority under
subsection (2)(a)(ii) only if the proposal area is wholly or partly within
the area of the local authority.
(8) Where the proposing authority proposes, under subsection (2)(a)(ii), 30
that two or more local authorities should be designated as the oversight
authority, it may also propose—
(a) that a specified function should be exercisable by one of those
local authorities, or
(b) that a specified function should be exercisable by two or more 35
of those local authorities jointly.
For this purpose, “specified” means specified in the proposal.
(9) In this section—
“local authority” means—
(a) a district council, 40
(b) a county council, or
(c) a London borough council;
“locally-led proposal” has the meaning given by subsection (2);
200 Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill
Part 8—Development corporations 
“proposing authority” means—
(a) the local authority which makes a locally-led proposal,
or
(b)
5
if two or more local authorities make such a proposal,
those authorities acting jointly;
and where the proposing authority consists of two or more
authorities acting jointly, each is a “constituent council” of the
proposing authority.</quote>

   <summary>This change allows local authorities in England, either individually or jointly, to propose the designation of an area of land as the site of a proposed new town. The proposal must include the name of the development corporation to be established and the local authority or authorities designated as the oversight authority. The proposal may also include other matters that the Secretary of State can make provisions for. The proposing authority must consult with relevant stakeholders and consider their comments. If there are disagreements with a local authority or the Greater London Authority, the proposing authority must publish a statement explaining the reasons for non-acceptance.</summary>

   <quote>Additional compensation in respect of an acquisition is 15 payable to an eligible person only if, in relation to that (1) person, the alternative amount is greater than the original amount.</quote>
   <quote>The amount payable is the difference between the two amounts.</quote>
   <quote>The “original amount” is the amount of compensation awarded or agreed to be paid to the person in respect of the acquisition.</quote>
   <quote>The “alternative amount” is the amount of compensation that would have been assessed as due to the person in respect of the acquisition had compensation been assessed without the application of section 14A.</quote>
   <quote>If the original amount was agreed, the relevant valuation date for the purposes of the assessment imagined under sub-paragraph (4) is the date on which the agreement was concluded.</quote>
   <quote>In relation to the determination of an amount of additional compensation under this Schedule, section 17(2)(b) applies as if its reference to the amount of compensation were to the amount of additional compensation.</quote>

   <quote>Additional compensation payable under this Schedule to a person in the person’s capacity as a mortgagee (or to a person exercising rights of a mortgagee) is to be applied towards the discharge of the sums secured by the mortgage.</quote>
   <quote>If there is no remaining sum secured by the mortgage, the additional compensation that would be payable as described in sub-paragraph (4) is instead payable to the person who is an eligible person by virtue of the interest that was subject to the mortgage.</quote>

It states that if the compensation to which an eligible person was entitled remains unpaid and would now vest in another person, that person has the rights to be paid the compensation. The change also specifies the treatment of additional compensation paid to the other person and clarifies the reference to compensation in cases involving mortgages.</summary>

   <subject>Section 6: Consequential losses</subject>

   <quote>The relevant authority may by regulations provide for additional compensation payable on a claim under paragraph 1(5) to include (in addition to any amount payable under paragraph 2) an amount to make good qualifying losses.</quote>
   <quote>“Qualifying losses” are financial losses shown to have been suffered by an eligible person, or a person entitled to exercise the rights of the eligible person under paragraph 5, as a result of the compensation initially payable to the eligible person in respect of the acquisition being of the original amount rather than the alternative amount.</quote>
   <quote>In the case of an eligible person who is so by virtue of an interest that was subject to a mortgage, the reference in sub-paragraph (2) to compensation payable to the eligible person is to be taken to include compensation payable to the mortgagee of that interest.</quote>
   <quote>Regulations under this paragraph may limit the qualifying losses in respect of which additional compensation is payable under the regulations by reference to— (a) a description of loss, (b) an amount, or (c) any other circumstance.</quote>

   <summary>The proposed change allows for additional compensation to include an amount to make up for qualifying losses. Qualifying losses are defined as financial losses suffered by an eligible person or a person entitled to exercise the rights of the eligible person due to the initial compensation being of the original amount instead of the alternative amount. The change also clarifies that compensation payable to the mortgagee of an interest subject to a mortgage is included in the reference to compensation payable to the eligible person.</summary>

   <quote>The relevant authority may by regulations make provision— (a) about the procedure for applications under paragraph 1(2) or claims under paragraph 1(5) (including provision about the costs of such applications or claims); (b) about steps that must be taken by the acquiring authority or the confirming authority for the purposes of publicising or giving notice of a direction for additional compensation; (c) for interest to be applied to amounts of additional compensation that are payable; (d) about how or when additional compensation (and any interest) is to be paid.</quote>
   <quote>Regulations under this paragraph about costs of claims under paragraph 1(5)— (a) may modify or disapply section 29 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (costs or expenses) or provisions in Tribunal Procedure Rules relating to costs; (b) may apply (with or without modifications) section 4 of this Act; and section 4 of this Act does not apply in relation to such a claim unless so applied.</quote>

   <summary>The proposed change empowers the relevant authority to make regulations regarding the procedure for applications and claims, steps to be taken by acquiring and confirming authorities, interest on additional compensation, and the payment of additional compensation. It also allows for regulations to modify or disapply certain provisions related to costs and to apply section 4 of the Act to claims, with section 4 not applying unless specifically applied.</summary>

   <quote>In this Schedule— “the confirming authority” means— (i) the person who confirmed the compulsory purchase order, or (ii) any successor to that person’s function of confirming compulsory purchase orders of the type in question; “the acquisition” or “the compulsory purchase order” are to the acquisition or order by virtue of which paragraph 1 applies; “designated high street” means a street for the time being designated under subsection (1); “designated town centre” means an area for the time being designated under subsection (2).</quote>
   <quote>For the purposes of this Part, any use of premises that falls within any of the following sub-paragraphs is a “high-street use”— (a) use as a shop or office; (b) use for the provision of services to persons who include visiting members of the public; (c) use as a restaurant, bar, public house, café or other establishment selling food or drink for immediate consumption; (d) use for public entertainment or recreation; (e) use as a communal hall or meeting-place; (f) use for manufacturing or other industrial processes of a sort that can (in each case) reasonably be carried on in proximity to, and compatibly with, the preceding uses.</quote>
   <quote>For the purposes of this Part, premises are “qualifying high-street premises” if— (a) they are situated on a designated high street or in a designated town centre, and (b) the local authority considers them to be suitable for a high-street use.</quote>
   <quote>But premises are not “qualifying high-street premises” if they are, or when last used were, used wholly or mainly as a warehouse.</quote>
   <quote>For the purposes of this Part, “suitable high-street use”, in relation to premises, means a high-street use for which the local authority considers the premises to be suitable.</quote>
   <quote>In considering the uses for which premises are suitable, a local authority is to have regard to any works that it expects— (a) the landlord would be required to carry out, or (b) the tenant would be permitted to, and likely to, carry out, if a contract was entered into under section 194 and a tenancy was granted further to it.</quote>
   <quote>For the purposes of this Part, the “vacancy condition” is satisfied in relation to premises on a given day if— (a) the premises are unoccupied on that day, and (b) either— (i) the premises were unoccupied for the whole of the period of one year ending with the previous day, or (ii) during the period of two years ending with the previous day, the premises were unoccupied on at least 366 days.</quote>
   <quote>For the purposes of subsection (1), premises are occupied on a day during which they begin or cease to be occupied.</quote>

   <quote>A state of affairs does not amount to the occupation of premises for the purposes of this section unless it involves the use of the premises for activity that— (a) is substantial, (b) is sustained, and (c) involves the regular presence of people at the premises.</quote>

   <summary>The proposed change provides definitions and interpretations for various terms used in the Schedule. It defines "designated high street" and "designated town centre" as streets and areas designated by the local authority. It also defines "high-street use" as any use of premises falling within specific categories, and "qualifying high-street premises" as premises situated on a designated high street or in a designated town centre and considered suitable for a high-street use by the local authority. The change further clarifies the vacancy condition for premises and allows for regulations to alter the circumstances in which the vacancy condition is satisfied. It also specifies that a state of affairs does not constitute occupation unless it involves substantial, sustained activity with regular presence of people.</summary>

(2) A local planning authority are eligible for the purposes of subsection 30 (1) if— (a) they are not a London borough council, (b) their area is not within, or the same as, the area of a combined authority established under section 103 of the Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill 333 Schedule 7—Plan making Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009, (c) they are not prescribed as ineligible for the purposes of subsection (1), (d) they are not already party to an agreement under subsection 5 (1), and (e) either— (i) no joint spatial development strategy is operative in relation to the area of the authority, or (ii) such a strategy is operative in relation to the area but the authority wish to enter into an agreement under subsection (1) in anticipation of the existing strategy being withdrawn or the authority withdrawing from it. (3) The Secretary of State may prescribe an authority under subsection 15 (2)(c) only if the Secretary of State considers it appropriate to do so because of an exercise, or a contemplated exercise, of the powers in section 16 of the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 20 2016 or section 17 of the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023 (powers to transfer etc public authority functions to certain local authorities). (4) In this section and sections 15AA to 15AI— “the joint strategy area”, in relation to a joint spatial development strategy, means the combined area of the participating authorities; “the participating authorities”— (a) in relation to a joint spatial development strategy that is being (or has been) prepared but has yet to become 30 operative, means the local planning authorities that are for the time being party to the agreement to prepare it, and (b) in relation to a joint spatial development strategy that is operative, means the local planning authorities that have adopted it and not since withdrawn from it, and, unless the context otherwise requires, means those 35 authorities acting jointly under such arrangements as they put in place for the purpose; “participating authority” is to be read accordingly; 40 “preparation agreement” means an agreement under subsection (1). 15AA Contents of joint spatial development strategy (1) A joint spatial development strategy must include a statement of the policies (however expressed) of the participating authorities, in 334 Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill Schedule 7—Plan making relation to the development and use of land in the joint strategy area, which are— (a) of strategic importance to that area, and (b) designed to achieve objectives that relate to the particular characteristics or circumstances of that area. (2) A joint spatial development strategy may specify or describe infrastructure the provision of which the participating authorities consider to be of strategic importance to the joint strategy area for the purposes of— (a) supporting or facilitating development in that area, 10 (b) mitigating, or adapting to, climate change, or (c) promoting or improving the economic, social or environmental well-being of that area. (3) 15 A joint spatial development strategy may specify or describe affordable housing the provision of which the participating authorities consider to be of strategic importance to the joint strategy area. (4) For the purposes of subsections (1) to (3), a matter— (a) may be of strategic importance to the joint strategy area if it does not affect the whole of that area, but (b) is not to be regarded as being of strategic importance to that area unless it is of strategic importance to the area of more than one of the participating authorities. (5) The Secretary of State may prescribe further matters the joint spatial development strategy may, or must, deal with. (6) A joint spatial development strategy must contain such diagrams, illustrations or other descriptive or explanatory matter relating to its contents as may be prescribed. (7) A joint spatial development strategy may make different provision for different cases or for different parts of the joint strategy area. (8) A joint spatial development strategy must be designed to secure that the use and development of land in the joint strategy area contribute to the mitigation of, and adaption to, climate change. (9) A joint spatial development strategy must not— (a) include anything that is not permitted or required by or 35 under the preceding provisions of this section, (b) specify particular sites where development should take place, or (c) be inconsistent with or (in substance) repeat any national development management policy.</quote>

(2) In making the relevant assessment, the competent authority must assume— (a) in a case within paragraph (1)(d)(i), that the plant will meet the nitrogen nutrient pollution standard on and after the upgrade date; (b) in a case within paragraph (1)(d)(ii), that the plant will meet the phosphorus nutrient pollution standard on and after the upgrade date.</quote>
   <quote>85B Assumptions to be made about nutrient pollution standards: general development orders (1) This regulation applies where— (a) a local planning authority (within the meaning given by regulation 78(1)) makes a decision on an application under regulation 77 (general development orders: approval of local planning authority) for approval as mentioned in regulation 75 relating to proposed development in England, (b) the authority is required by regulation 77(6) to make an appropriate assessment of the implications of the proposed development, (c) any waste water from the proposed development would be dealt with by a plant in England that, at the time of the decision, is— (i) a nitrogen significant plant, or (ii) a phosphorus significant plant, and (d) the decision is made before the upgrade date. (2) In making the relevant assessment the local planning authority must assume— (a) in a case within paragraph (1)(c)(i), that the plant will meet the nitrogen nutrient pollution standard on and after the upgrade date; (b) in a case within paragraph (1)(c)(ii), that the plant will meet the phosphorus nutrient pollution standard on and after the upgrade date.</quote>
   <quote>85C Direction that assumptions are not to apply (1) The assumptions in regulations 85A(2) and 85B(2) do not apply in relation to a particular plant and a particular nutrient pollution standard if the Secretary of State so directs. (2) A direction under this regulation may be made in relation to a plant and a standard only if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the plant will not be able to meet the standard by the upgrade date.</quote>

   <summary>Regulations 85A and 85B establish assumptions to be made about nutrient pollution standards in relevant assessments and decisions made by competent authorities and local planning authorities, respectively. These assumptions apply to plants in England that deal with waste water and are categorized as nitrogen significant or phosphorus significant. Regulation 85C allows the Secretary of State to direct that these assumptions do not apply to a specific plant and standard if it is determined that the plant will not be able to meet the standard by the upgrade date.</summary>

(5) In paragraph (1) “potential development”, in relation to a relevant decision, means development— (a) that could be carried out by virtue of the planning permission, development order or scheme to which the decision relates, or (b) to which the decision otherwise relates. (6) In this regulation “relevant assessment” means— (a) where the assessment provisions apply and an appropriate assessment of the implications of the plan or project for a site is required by regulation 63(1), that assessment; (b) where the review provisions apply and an appropriate assessment is required by regulation 65(2), that assessment. 85B Assumptions to be made about nutrient pollution standards: general development orders (1) This regulation applies where— (a) a local planning authority (within the meaning given by regulation 78(1)) makes a decision on an application under regulation 77 (general development orders: approval of local planning authority) for approval as mentioned in regulation 75 relating to proposed development in England, (b) the authority is required by regulation 77(6) to make an appropriate assessment of the implications of the proposed development, (c) any waste water from the proposed development would be dealt with by a plant in England that, at the time of the decision, is— (i) a nitrogen significant plant, or (ii) a phosphorus significant plant, and (d) the decision is made before the upgrade date.

(2) A direction under this regulation may be made in relation to a plant and a standard only if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the plant will not be able to meet the standard by the upgrade date. (3) The Secretary of State may revoke a direction under this regulation if satisfied that the plant will meet the standard on the upgrade date.

   <summary>Schedule 13 introduces amendments to the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 regarding assumptions about nutrient pollution standards in the assessment of plans and projects related to planning. It establishes regulations 85A, 85B, and 85C, which outline the assumptions to be made about nutrient pollution standards in relevant assessments and decisions made by competent authorities and local planning authorities. Regulation 85C allows the Secretary of State to direct that these assumptions do not apply to a specific plant and standard if it is determined that the plant will not be able to meet the standard by the upgrade date.</summary>
