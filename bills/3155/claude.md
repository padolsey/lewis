The Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill is wide-ranging legislation that proposes reforms across areas like local governance, planning, housing, infrastructure, and the environment in England and Wales.

Introduced in May 2022, the bill aims to:

 * Streamline the planning system by modernizing plan-making and permitting faster development.
 * Empower local leaders with more control over governance, planning, and infrastructure.
 * Boost local economies through new regeneration funding and high street revitalization powers.
 * Reform the leasehold and housing sector with new regulation and tenant protections.
 * Change infrastructure funding models by introducing an Infrastructure Levy on development.
 * Strengthen environmental regulation by requiring assessments against new statutory environmental outcomes.

However, aspects of the bill have prompted concerns:

 * Expanded local powers could lead to inconsistent, poor quality decisions without adequate central oversight.
 * Planning system changes reduce accountability by limiting appeal grounds and enforcement timeframes.
 * Infrastructure Levy lacks details on ensuring affordable housing amidst new development.
Acquisition reforms inadequately address risks like lowball compensation offers to landowners.
Environmental provisions don't ensure comprehensive, enforceable protections and standards.
