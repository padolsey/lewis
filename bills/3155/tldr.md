Wide-ranging reforms to legislation in areas like local governance, planning, environment, housing, infrastructure, justice, and economic policy in England and Wales. Proposed changes aim to empower local councils over planning, housing, & transport, and make it easier for locals to block new developments. Plans also limit appeal grounds for developers, mandate landlords to rent out vacant properties, reform leasehold agreements, end "no fault" evictions, introduce Infrastructure Levy on new developments, and strengthen environmental assessments.
