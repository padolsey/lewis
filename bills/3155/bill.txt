(i) so that it instead contains the levelling-up missions that His
Majesty’s Government is to pursue for the remaining mission
period, and
(ii)
30
to make any changes to the mission progress methodology and
metrics that the Minister considers appropriate in consequence
of doing so, and
(b) as soon as is reasonably practicable after revising it, the Minister must
lay the revised statement before each House of Parliament and then
publish it.

the effect of the works on the character of the building as one of special
architectural or historic interest, they consider it is expedient that the
works (or part of them) be stopped immediately.
(3) A temporary stop notice must be in writing and must—
Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill 103
Part 3—Planning
Chapter 3—Heritage 
(a) specify the works in question,
(b) prohibit execution of the works (or so much of them as is
specified in the notice),

(b) to have an interest in the building, or
(c) to be an occupier of the building. 10
(5) The authority must display a copy of the notice on the building; and

15
that it was not practicable to secure safety or health or, as the
case may be, the preservation of the building by works of repair
or works for affording temporary support or shelter,
(c) that the works carried out were limited to the minimum
measures immediately necessary, and
(d)

the works was given to the local planning authority as soon
as reasonably practicable.

compensation by the authority in respect of any loss or damage directly
attributable to the effect of the notice.

293E instead of to the authority to whom it could otherwise have been
made, a development order may (with or without modifications) apply
126 Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill
Part 3—Planning
Chapter 4—Grant and implementation of planning permission 
to the application any enactment that relates to applications of that
kind when made to that authority.
(6) A development order which makes provision under this section to
5
apply to an application under section 293D or 293E (with or without
modifications) any requirement to disclose information may include
provision to secure that the requirement would not result in the public
disclosure of sensitive information.
(7) For the purposes of subsection (6), information is “sensitive” if the
Secretary of State directs that—
(a) it relates to matters of national security or measures taken or 10
to be taken to ensure the security of any premises or property,
and

293I Deciding applications made under section 293D and 293E
(1) An application made to the Secretary of State under section 293D or 15

by the Secretary of State for the purpose instead of by the Secretary
of State, subject to section 293J.
(2)

subsection to determine a direct application then, at any time before
the person has determined the application, the Secretary of State may—

(b) appoint another person to determine the application instead.
(3)
25
A person appointed under this section to determine a direct application
has the same powers and duties that the Secretary of State has under
section 293H.
(4) Where a direct application is determined by a person appointed under
this section, the person’s decision is to be treated as that of the
Secretary of State.
(5) Except as provided by Part 12, the validity of that decision is not to 30
be questioned in any proceedings whatsoever.
(6) It is not a ground of application to the High Court under section 288
that a direct application ought to have been determined by the
35
Secretary of State and not by a person appointed under this section
unless the applicant challenges the person’s power to determine the
direct application before the person’s decision on the direct application
is given.
(7) Where any enactment (other than this section and section 319A)—
(a)
40
refers (or is to be read as referring) to the Secretary of State in
a context relating to or capable of relating to a direct application
Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill 127
Part 3—Planning
Chapter 4—Grant and implementation of planning permission 
(otherwise than by referring to the application having been
made to the Secretary of State), or
(b) refers (or is to be read as referring) to anything (other than the
5
making of the application) done or authorised or required to
be done by, to or before the Secretary of State in connection
with any such application,
then, so far as the context permits, the enactment is to be read, in
relation to an application determined or to be determined by a person
10
appointed under this section, as if the reference to the Secretary of
State were or included a reference to that person.
293J Applications under section 293D or 293E: determination by the
Secretary of State
(1) The Secretary of State may direct that an application made to the
15
Secretary of State under section 293D or 293E (“a direct application”)
is to be determined by the Secretary of State instead of by a person
appointed under section 293I.
(2) Where a direction is given under subsection (1), the Secretary of State
must serve a copy of the direction on—
(a)
20
the person, if any, appointed under section 293I to determine
the application concerned,
(b) the applicant, and
(c) the local planning authority.
(3) Where a direct application is to be determined by the Secretary of
State in consequence of a direction under subsection (1)—
(a) in determining the application, the Secretary of State may take 25
into account any report made to the Secretary of State by any
person previously appointed to determine the application, and
(b) subject to that, the provisions of the planning Acts which are
30
relevant to the application apply to it as if section 293I had
never applied to it.
(4) The Secretary of State may by a further direction revoke a direction
under subsection (1) at any time before the determination of the direct
application concerned.
(5)
35
Where a direction is given under subsection (4), the Secretary of State
must serve a copy of the direction on—
(a) the person, if any, previously appointed under section 293I to
determine the application concerned,
(b) the applicant, and
(c) the local planning authority.
(6) Where a direction is given under subsection (4) in relation to a direct 40
application—
128 Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill
Part 3—Planning
Chapter 4—Grant and implementation of planning permission 
(a) anything done by or on behalf of the Secretary of State in
connection with the application which might have been done
by a person appointed under section 293I to determine the
5
application is, unless the person appointed under section 293I
to determine the application directs otherwise, to be treated as
having been done by that person, and
(b) subject to that, section 293I applies to the application as if no
direction under subsection (1) had been given in relation to
the application.”

(8) If the local planning authority decides not to grant planning permission
in accordance with this section, it must refuse the application.
(9)
15

purposes of subsection (5) (but not for the purposes of subsection (7)),
20
any change to the permission made under section 96A is to be

condition,

plan”) was approved for the purposes of the condition
as it attaches to that permission,
(iii) planning permission is granted in accordance with this
section, and
(iv) that planning permission is consistent with the 35
post-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat
as specified in the earlier biodiversity gain plan,
the earlier biodiversity gain plan is to be regarded as approved
40
for the purposes of the condition as it attaches to the planning
permission granted in accordance with this section.
(12) Nothing in this section authorises the disapplication of the condition
under section 90B (condition relating to development progress reports

section to the local planning authority is to be read as a reference to
the Secretary of State.

40
the Secretary of State determines that the completion notice was not
served on a person on whom it should have been served, the notice

Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill 135
Part 3—Planning
Chapter 4—Grant and implementation of planning permission 
that person nor the appellant has been substantially prejudiced by
that fact.
(8) Subsection (5) of section 250 of the Local Government Act 1972 (which
5
authorises a Minister holding an inquiry under that section to make
orders with respect to the costs of the parties) applies in relation to

(a) in a case where a commencement notice under section 93G has
been given, whether the development—
(i) was begun by the date specified in the notice, and

specified in it,
(b) whether a completion notice was served in respect of the earlier
development under section 93H or (before the coming into

circumstances, referred to in subsection (1B).”;

to 6 of Schedule 2A, those intentions must include the provision
of a certain number of units of affordable housing.

commitments as they apply in respect of the compulsory
purchase order.
(7)
25
The confirming authority may permit the acquiring authority
to amend the statement of commitments before the decision
whether to confirm the order is made.
(8) But the confirming authority may do so—
(a) only if satisfied that the amendment would not be unfair
30
to any person who made or could have made a relevant
objection for the purposes of section 13, and
(b) if the authorising enactment is listed in any of
paragraphs 1 to 6 of Schedule 2A, only if the statement
of commitments as amended will still comply with
subsection (5).
(9) If the confirming authority decides to confirm the order in 35
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Part—
(a) it may confirm the order with the direction included if
satisfied that the direction is justified in the public
interest;
(b) otherwise, it must modify the order so as to remove 40
the direction.

(c) after the second Schedule insert—
“SCHEDULE 2A Section 14A(6) 5
ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION WHERE SECTION 14A APPLIED
Directions for additional compensation
1 (1) This paragraph applies if—
(a)
10
an interest in land has been acquired further to a
compulsory purchase order, and
(b) the order directed that compensation was to be
assessed in accordance with section 14A.
(2) The confirming authority must, on an application by an
15
eligible person, make a direction for additional compensation
if it appears to the confirming authority that the following
conditions are met.
(3) Those conditions are—
(a) that the statement of commitments has not been
fulfilled,
(b) either— 20
(i) that the period of 10 years beginning with the
date on which the compulsory purchase order
became operative has expired, or
(ii)
25
that there is no longer any realistic prospect
of the statement of commitments being
fulfilled within that period, and
(c) that the initial direction would not have been
confirmed on the basis of a statement of commitments
30
reflecting what has in fact been done with the project
land since its acquisition.
(4) In sub-paragraph (3)—
“the statement of commitments” means the statement
of commitments submitted in connection with the
35
compulsory purchase order under section 15A(3) of
the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 (and if the statement
was amended after its submission, means the
statement as amended);
“the initial direction” means the direction referred to in
40
sub-paragraph (1)(b) (and that direction was
“confirmed” when the compulsory purchase order
was confirmed with the inclusion of the direction);
Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill 227
Part 9—Compulsory purchase 
“the project land” means the land treated as the project
land for the purposes of the statement of
commitments;
5
and that statement is “fulfilled” if what is done with that
land after its acquisition is materially in accordance with the
statement.
(5) The effect of a direction for additional compensation is that
each eligible person may make a claim to the acquiring
10
authority for any additional compensation in respect of the
acquisition payable to the person under this Schedule.
(6) A person is an “eligible person” for the purposes of this
Schedule if the person was entitled to compensation in
respect of the acquisition (and see also paragraph 4(1)).
Amount of additional compensation
2 Additional compensation in respect of an acquisition is 15
payable to an eligible person only if, in relation to that
(1)
person, the alternative amount is greater than the original
amount.
(2)
20
The amount payable is the difference between the two
amounts.
(3) The “original amount” is the amount of compensation
awarded or agreed to be paid to the person in respect of the
acquisition.
(4)
25
The “alternative amount” is the amount of compensation
that would have been assessed as due to the person in
respect of the acquisition had compensation been assessed
without the application of section 14A.
(5) If the original amount was agreed, the relevant valuation
30
date for the purposes of the assessment imagined under
sub-paragraph (4) is the date on which the agreement was
concluded.
(6) In relation to the determination of an amount of additional
compensation under this Schedule, section 17(2)(b) applies
35
as if its reference to the amount of compensation were to
the amount of additional compensation.
(7) A certificate issued under section 17 (or 18) after the award
or agreement referred to in sub-paragraph (3) is to have
effect for the purposes of the assessment imagined under
40
sub-paragraph (4) as if it had been issued before that
assessment.
(8) Any amount of compensation that is or would be attributable
to disturbance, severance or injurious affection is to be
ignored for the purposes of sub-paragraphs (3) and (4).
228 Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill
Part 9—Compulsory purchase 
Time limit for application for direction
3 An application under paragraph 1(2) may not be made after
the expiry of the period of 13 years beginning with the date
on which the compulsory purchase order became operative.
Mortgages 5
4 For the purposes of this Schedule an “eligible person”
includes a person who would have been entitled to
(1)
compensation in respect of the acquisition but for the
10
existence of a mortgage (but the mortgage is in that case still
to be taken into account in determining the original and
alternative amounts under paragraph 2).
(2) An amount agreed or awarded to be paid to a mortgagee
under section 15 or 16 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965
15
in respect of the acquisition is to be treated for the purposes
of this Schedule as compensation in respect of the acquisition.
(3) The reference in sub-paragraph (2) to an amount paid under
section 15 or 16 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 (“the
applicable section”) includes an amount paid under section
20
52ZA or 52ZB of the Land Compensation Act 1973 and taken
into account by virtue of section 52ZC(7)(d) of that Act for
the purposes of the applicable section.
(4) Additional compensation payable under this Schedule to a
person in the person’s capacity as a mortgagee (or to a
25
person exercising rights of a mortgagee) is to be applied
towards the discharge of the sums secured by the mortgage.
(5) If there is no remaining sum secured by the mortgage, the
additional compensation that would be payable as described
in sub-paragraph (4) is instead payable to the person who
30
is an eligible person by virtue of the interest that was subject
to the mortgage.
(6) If the additional compensation that would be payable as
described in sub-paragraph (4) exceeds the total of the
remaining sums secured by the mortgage, the amount of the
35
excess is instead payable to the person who is an eligible
person by virtue of the interest that was subject to the
mortgage.
Successors-in-title
5 This paragraph applies if, had the compensation to which
40
an eligible person was entitled in respect of the acquisition
(1)
remained unpaid, the right to be paid it would now vest in
some other person (assuming that it remained enforceable
Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill 229
Part 9—Compulsory purchase 
and any obligations in respect of the right had been complied
with).
(2) If the eligible person is still alive or in existence, the rights
5
that the eligible person would have under this Schedule are
exercisable by the other person and not by the eligible
person.
(3) If the eligible person is no longer alive or in existence, the
rights that the eligible person would have under this
10
Schedule if that person were still alive or in existence are
exercisable by the other person.
(4) The right exercisable by the other person under
sub-paragraph (2) or (3) is subject to any restriction, condition
or other incident to which the right vested in that person as
imagined under sub-paragraph (1) would be subject.
(5) Additional compensation paid to the other person by virtue 15
of sub-paragraph (2) or (3) must be dealt with by the person
in any way in which the person would have to deal with
compensation paid to that person further to the right vested
in that person as imagined under sub-paragraph (1).
(6) If a person is an eligible person by virtue of paragraph 4(1), 20
the reference in sub-paragraph (1) to compensation to which
the person was entitled is to be read as a reference to the
compensation to which the person would have been entitled
but for the mortgage.
Consequential losses 25
6 The relevant authority may by regulations provide for
additional compensation payable on a claim under paragraph
(1)
1(5) to include (in addition to any amount payable under
paragraph 2) an amount to make good qualifying losses.
(2) “Qualifying losses” are financial losses shown to have been 30
suffered by an eligible person, or a person entitled to exercise
the rights of the eligible person under paragraph 5, as a
result of the compensation initially payable to the eligible
35
person in respect of the acquisition being of the original
amount rather than the alternative amount.
(3) In the case of an eligible person who is so by virtue of an
interest that was subject to a mortgage, the reference in
sub-paragraph (2) to compensation payable to the eligible
40
person is to be taken to include compensation payable to
the mortgagee of that interest.
(4) Regulations under this paragraph may limit the qualifying
losses in respect of which additional compensation is payable
under the regulations by reference to—
230 Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill
Part 9—Compulsory purchase 
(a) a description of loss,
(b) an amount, or
(c) any other circumstance.
Procedure etc
7 (1) The relevant authority may by regulations make provision— 5
(a) about the procedure for applications under paragraph
1(2) or claims under paragraph 1(5) (including
provision about the costs of such applications or
claims);
(b) about steps that must be taken by the acquiring 10
authority or the confirming authority for the purposes
of publicising or giving notice of a direction for
additional compensation;
(c)
15

compensation that are payable;

may apply (with or without modifications) section 4
of this Act;
and section 4 of this Act does not apply in relation to such
a claim unless so applied.

authorities may at any time prepare and adopt alterations of the
strategy.
(2)
35
The Secretary of State may direct the participating authorities to
exercise the power in subsection (1) in such manner and within
such time as are specified in the direction.
(3) Sections 15AB to 15AD apply in relation to the preparation and
adoption of an alteration under subsection (1) as they apply in
Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill 339
Schedule 7—Plan making 
relation to the preparation and adoption of a joint spatial
development strategy; and the strategy as altered must still conform
to section 15AA.
(4)
5
But sections 15AB and 15AC do not apply in relation to an alteration
if—
(a) the alteration is made in response to the withdrawal of a
participating authority under section 15AH(2), and
(b) the strategy as altered will have substantially the same effect
10
in relation to the joint strategy area (as it stands following
the withdrawal) as it had in relation to that area before the
alteration.
15AG Withdrawal before strategy becomes operative
(1) This section applies if a preparation agreement is in force but the
15
joint spatial development strategy to which the agreement relates
(“the proposed strategy”) has not become operative.
(2) A participating authority may withdraw from the agreement before
the proposed strategy is published for consultation.
(3) A participating authority may withdraw from the agreement after
20
the proposed strategy is published for consultation if they have
given at least 12 weeks’ notice to each other participating authority
of their intention to do so.
(4) A participating authority that have adopted the strategy under
section 15AD(1) may not withdraw from the agreement under
25
subsection (3) unless they have first rescinded the resolution
adopting the strategy.
(5) A withdrawal under subsection (2) or (3) is effected by notice given
to each other participating authority.
(6) The participating authorities may cancel the agreement at any time.
(7)
30
If the withdrawal of a participating authority under subsection (2)
or (3) means that there are no longer two or more participating
authorities, the agreement is deemed to be cancelled under
subsection (6).
(8) The participating authorities may, and if the agreement is cancelled
35
must, withdraw the proposed strategy if it has been published for
consultation.
(9) On the withdrawal of the proposed strategy, the participating
authorities must—
(a) withdraw the copies made available for inspection under
section 15AB(1)(b), and
(b) give notice of the withdrawal to— 40
340 Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill
Schedule 7—Plan making 
(i) each body or person to whom a copy was sent under
section 15AB(1)(c), and
(ii) any other body or person who made representations
5
in accordance with the regulations (see section
15AB(6));
and any participating authority that have adopted the strategy are
deemed to rescind the resolution by which they did so.
(10) In the application of subsections (8) and (9) where the agreement
10
has been cancelled, the “participating authorities” are to be taken
to be the authorities that were the participating authorities
immediately before the cancellation.
(11) If—
(a) a participating authority withdraw from the agreement under
subsection (3),
(b) the agreement is not cancelled under subsection (6), and 15
(c) but for this subsection, the remaining participating authorities
would, in response to the withdrawal, modify the proposed
strategy so that it would have a substantially different effect
20
on the joint strategy area (as it stands following the
withdrawal) from that which the version published for
consultation would have had on that area,
the participating authorities must, instead of modifying the proposed
strategy, withdraw it under subsection (8).
(12)
25
For the purposes of this section and section 15AI, a proposed
strategy is “published for consultation” when a draft of it is made
available for inspection under section 15AB(1)(b) or sent to any
person under section 15AB(1)(c).
(13) If a proposed strategy is withdrawn under subsection (8), the fact
30
that the strategy was published for consultation is to be disregarded
for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3).
15AH Withdrawal after strategy becomes operative
(1) This section applies if a joint spatial development strategy is
operative.
(2) A participating authority may withdraw from the strategy if—
(a) the period of five years beginning with the day on which 35
the strategy became operative has elapsed, and
(b) the authority have given at least 12 weeks’ notice to the
other participating authorities of their intention to do so.
(3)
40
A withdrawal under subsection (2) is effected by notice given to
each other participating authority.
Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill 341
Schedule 7—Plan making 
(4) The participating authorities may withdraw the strategy at any time.
(5) If the withdrawal of a participating authority under subsection (2)
means that there are no longer two or more participating authorities,
5
the joint spatial development strategy is to be treated as having
been withdrawn under subsection (4).
(6) The Secretary of State may direct the participating authorities to
withdraw the strategy if the Secretary of State thinks that the
strategy is unsatisfactory.
(7)
10
If a participating authority withdraw from the strategy, the other
participating authorities must consider whether to alter the strategy
under section 15AF or withdraw it under subsection (4).
(8) If a participating authority withdraw from the strategy, the strategy
ceases to be operative in relation to the area of that authority
(irrespective of whether it is altered under section 15AF).
15AI Effect of creation of combined authority in joint strategy area 15
(1) This section applies if an order is made under section 103 of the
Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act
2009 establishing a combined authority the area of which includes,
or is the same as, the area of a participating authority.
(2) Subsection (3) or (4) applies if the order is made before the proposed 20
joint spatial development strategy is published for consultation (see
section 15AG(12)).
(3) If the areas of at least two of the participating authorities are outside
25
the area of the combined authority, each participating authority
whose area is within the area of the combined authority are deemed,
on the making of the order, to withdraw from the preparation
agreement under section 15AG(2).
(4) If the area of none or only one of the participating authorities is
30
outside the area of the combined authority, the preparation
agreement is deemed, on the making of the order, to be cancelled
under section 15AG(6).
(5) Subsection (6) or (7) applies if the order is made after the proposed
joint spatial development strategy is published for consultation but
before the joint spatial development strategy becomes operative.
(6) If the areas of at least two of the participating authorities are outside 35
the area of the combined authority, each participating authority
whose area is within the area of the combined authority are deemed,
on the making of the order—

Schedule 7—Plan making 
(a) to withdraw from the preparation agreement under section
15AG(3) (despite not having given notice as required by that
provision), and
(b) to rescind any resolution adopting the strategy.
(7) If the area of none or only one of the participating authorities is 5
outside the area of the combined authority, the preparation
agreement is deemed, on the making of the order, to be cancelled
under section 15AG(6).
(8) Subsection (9) or (10) applies if—
(a) the joint spatial development strategy is operative, and 10
(b) the combined authority adopts a spatial development strategy
for its area.
(9) If the areas of at least two of the participating authorities are outside
15
the area of the combined authority, each participating authority
whose area is within the area of the combined authority is deemed,
on the adoption of the strategy by the combined authority, to
withdraw from the joint spatial development strategy under section
15AH(2) (even if the conditions in that provision are not met).
(10)
20
If the area of none or only one of the participating authorities is
outside the area of the combined authority, the joint spatial
development strategy is deemed, on the adoption of the strategy
by the combined authority, to be withdrawn under section 15AH(4).
(11) If a proposed strategy is withdrawn under section 15AG(8), the fact
25
that the strategy was published for consultation is to be disregarded
for the purposes of subsections (2) and (5).
