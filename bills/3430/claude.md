The Data Protection and Digital Information Bill proposes wide-ranging changes to how personal data and digital information are handled in the UK. It would expand the government's powers to access data held by companies for law enforcement and other public purposes. It would also allow more sharing of data between public bodies.

The bill proposes to replace the Information Commissioner's Office with a new regulatory body, the Information Commission. The current Information Commissioner is expected to transition into the role of the chair of the new Commission. This change has raised concerns among critics who fear it could reduce the independence of data protection oversight.

The bill introduces new Digital Verification Services, which will confirm people's identities using data held by public and private organizations. Supporters argue this will increase efficiency, but privacy advocates have raised concerns.

Other sections of the bill allow public authorities to disclose information to improve public services, permit the processing of personal data for research purposes with safeguards, and streamline international data transfers.

Overall, the bill represents a significant shift towards more data sharing and increased state powers to obtain data. The government argues that these changes will improve service delivery and law enforcement. However, privacy and rights groups have raised concerns, stating that the bill might go too far and reduce critical independent oversight. Despite these concerns, the bill attempts to ensure a level of accountability and transparency in the new Information Commission with specific regulations around appointment, terms, and responsibilities of its members. The wide scope of the changes makes the bill important for public understanding and debate.

### Specific changes worth scrutinizing, and reflections

 * The insertion of section 58A on senior responsible individuals. This introduces a new role that could improve accountability. However, the scope and responsibilities should be clearly defined, and the relationship of these individuals with the Information Commission, their role in data protection, and their accountability mechanisms need to be clarified.
 * The insertion of section 61A on records of processing. This increases transparency but may increase burdens on controllers. The requirements should be proportional to risk. Additionally, potential privacy concerns arising from maintaining detailed processing records, especially in relation to sensitive data, should be considered.
 * The insertion of sections 62 and 64 on customer data and business data. Giving the government power to compel sharing of data from private companies raises privacy concerns. It's also important to examine the safeguards in place to protect this data, such as restrictions on use, storage, and access.
 * The amendments related to transfers of personal data to third countries. The framework for such transfers needs robust safeguards for individuals' rights. Implications of these amendments on international relations, business operations, and individual rights should also be considered.
 * The changes giving the Secretary of State broader powers to amend regulations. There should be checks on how these powers are exercised, and it might be worth examining the criteria that would trigger these powers and the checks and balances that would prevent misuse.
 * The changes around the Information Commission, including its structure, funding model, and appointment processes. Its independence and effectiveness could be impacted. The implications of the new Commission's structure on data protection oversight, and the potential for conflicts of interest within the Commission given the terms of appointment and tenure, should also be considered.
 * The deletion of the office of Information Commissioner in section 101. This completely abolishes this oversight role. The impact on existing cases, investigations, and data protection protocols handled by this office should be examined.
 * The deletion of the office of Surveillance Camera Commissioner in section 105. This removes oversight of surveillance technology. The potential implications for surveillance practices and regulations, and the rights of individuals under surveillance, should be considered.
 * The broad power in section 93 to share information for law enforcement purposes. This should have appropriate limitations and safeguards. The potential for misuse of this power, and the need for robust checks and balances to prevent violation of privacy rights, should be considered.
 * The removal of requirements on local authorities to provide equipment for registrars in section 95. This could hamper their work. The effect this might have on the provision of services, and whether there are alternative provisions to ensure necessary equipment is provided, should be examined.
