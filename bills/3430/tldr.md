The Data Protection and Digital Information Bill proposes significant changes to how personal data and digital information are handled in the UK. It expands the government's powers to access data held by companies for law enforcement and other public purposes and allows for more data sharing between public bodies, with additional safeguards in place. The bill also establishes the Information Commission, replacing the Information Commissioner's Office, but transitions the current Information Commissioner into the role of the chair of the new Commission.
