The Illegal Migration Bill aims to deter illegal entry into the UK by speeding up removal of people who arrive illegally, restricting their ability to appeal or claim asylum/modern slavery protections, capping legal migration routes, and making it harder for those removed to later obtain settlement or citizenship. The bill faces criticism over limited rights of appeal for those facing removal and the potential impact on genuine asylum seekers and modern slavery victims.
