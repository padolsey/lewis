The Illegal Migration Bill aims to deter illegal entry into the UK by introducing measures to speed up the removal of people who arrive in the UK without valid entry clearance or permission. Here is a summary of what the bill does:

Overview:

 * Places a duty on the Home Secretary to make arrangements to remove people who arrive in the UK illegally, with limited exceptions such as unaccompanied children. These people can be detained pending removal.
 * Prevents people subject to removal under the bill from making asylum or human rights claims, limits access to legal aid, and restricts judicial reviews to challenge removal.
 * Disapplies modern slavery protections so people subject to removal cannot claim these protections.
 * Prevents settlement in the UK and access to citizenship for those subject to removal under the bill.
 * Allows asylum/human rights claims from nationals of 'safe countries' to be treated as inadmissible.
 * Caps number of people entering annually through safe and legal routes.

Areas of concern:

 * Limited rights of appeal and access to justice for those facing removal. Critics argue this undermines the rule of law.
 * Disapplying modern slavery protections could prevent genuine victims from getting support.
 * Inadmissibility provisions could prevent genuine asylum seekers from having claims heard.
 * Cap on legal routes could increase illegal migration by restricting opportunities to enter legally.

Areas needing scrutiny:

 * Safeguards and appeals process for people incorrectly identified for removal.
 * Implications for genuine modern slavery victims if protections disapplied.
 * How inadmissibility provisions will be applied - scope for refusal of genuine claims?
 * Appropriateness of legal routes cap and impact on illegal migration.
 * Adequacy of provisions for unaccompanied children.
