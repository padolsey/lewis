The UK government has introduced the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill to reform companies and partnerships in order to prevent economic crime. This wide-ranging bill aims to increase transparency in the corporate sector and equip regulators with more powers to tackle illicit finance. Some of the major provisions in the bill include:

### Tougher Rules on Company Formation and Directors

The bill introduces stricter requirements on verifying the identities of company directors and subscribers during incorporation. It also expands disqualification rules for directors found to be misleading regulators. These measures intend to prevent the use of 'shell companies' for illegal purposes.

### New Reporting and Verification Duties

Companies and partnerships will face expanded duties to verify identities and report any discrepancies to regulators. For example, businesses may need to verify customer identities against Companies House records. The scope of sanctions-related reporting is also widened.

### Increased Powers for the Registrar

The registrar will have more ability to reject and remove false documents from company registers. New provisions allow the registrar to query inconsistent information and require companies to resolve discrepancies. The registrar can also allocate unique identifiers and disclose information to combat crime.

### Reforms to Company Registers

Public access to registers is reformed to promote transparency while protecting privacy. Sensitive information like home addresses can be concealed from public view. But law enforcement agencies will gain access to further data to conduct investigations.

### Civil and Criminal Penalties

The bill introduces new civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with reporting duties and other corporate transparency rules. Offenses can be applied to both companies and individual officers.

### Rules on Cryptoassets

New measures will regulate cryptoassets in the context of confiscation orders, civil recovery, and anti-terrorist financing. This includes provisions to seize, freeze, and sell cryptoassets linked to suspected criminal activity.

The government promotes this bill as crucial to combating illicit finance. But its far-reaching nature raises concerns about excessive bureaucracy and overreach. The impact will depend on how proportionality balances transparency with privacy during implementation. Nonetheless, reforms are overdue to help regulate an evolving corporate landscape where shell companies enable economic crime.
