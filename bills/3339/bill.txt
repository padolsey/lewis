“(5A) On being satisfied as mentioned in section 195B(1) an appropriate
officer may seize any free property if the officer has reasonable
grounds for suspecting that it is a cryptoasset-related item.
(5B) A “cryptoasset-related item” is an item of property that is, or that
contains or gives access to information that is, likely to assist in the
seizure under subsection (1) of any cryptoasset.
(5C) The circumstances in which a cryptoasset is “seized” for the purposes
of subsection (1) include circumstances in which it is transferred into
a crypto wallet controlled by the appropriate officer.
(5D) If an appropriate officer is lawfully on any premises, the officer may,
for the purpose of—
(a) determining whether any property is a cryptoasset-related
item, or
(b) enabling or facilitating the seizure under subsection (1) of
any cryptoasset,
require any information which is stored in any electronic form and
accessible from the premises to be produced in a form in which it can
be taken away and in which it is visible and legible, or from which it
can readily be produced in a visible and legible form.
(5E) But subsection (5D) does not authorise an appropriate officer to
require a person to produce information which the person would be
entitled to refuse to provide on grounds of legal professional
privilege in proceedings in the High Court.
(5F) Where an appropriate officer has seized a cryptoasset-related item
under subsection (5A), they may use any information obtained from
it for the purpose of—
(a) identifying or gaining access to a crypto wallet, and
(b) by doing so, enabling or facilitating the seizure under
subsection (1) of any cryptoassets.”

and its subsequent detention, or
(b) the making of a crypto wallet freezing order under section
303Z37.

amount as the parties to the agreement agree is reasonable, having
regard to the loss suffered and any other relevant circumstances.

one excepted joint owner, the total amount to be paid under
subsection (1), and the part of that amount which is to be provided
by each person who holds any such associated property or who is an

authorised to do so by a senior officer.

expenses which, after giving effect to subsection (7), are

magistrates’ court or the sheriff (as the case may be) must have
regard to—
(a) the rights of any person who holds the associated property or
who is an excepted joint owner and the value to that person

application related, or
(ii) not to make an order under section 303Z41(4), or

(b) the making of an order under section 303Z45(7);

the reason that no order was made is that an order was
instead made under section 303Z44;
(d) a decision not to make an order under section 303Z45(7).
Paragraphs (c) and (d) do not apply if the application for the order

(a) before the end of the period within which an appeal may be
made (whether under section 303Z47 or otherwise), or
(b) if an appeal is made within that period, before the appeal is
determined or otherwise disposed of.
(4) The realisation of property under subsection (2) must be carried out,
so far as practicable, in the manner best calculated to maximise the
amount obtained for the property.
(5) Where an enforcement officer is satisfied that—
(a) it is not reasonably practicable to realise any cryptoasset, or
(b) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the realisation of
any cryptoasset would be contrary to the public interest,

(6) But—
(a) the enforcement officer may destroy the cryptoasset only if
the officer is a senior officer or is authorised to do so by a
senior officer, and

may be made (whether under section 303Z47 or
otherwise), or

appeal is determined or otherwise disposed of.
(7) The question of whether the realisation of the cryptoasset would be
contrary to the public interest is to be determined with particular
reference to how likely it is that the entry of the cryptoasset into
general circulation would facilitate criminal conduct by any person.
303Z49 Proceeds of realisation
(1) This section applies where any cryptoasset or other item of property
is realised under section 303Z48.
(2) The proceeds of the realisation must be applied as follows—
(a) first, they must be applied in making any payment required
to be made by virtue of section 303Z45(9);
(b) second, they must be applied in making any payment of legal
expenses which, after giving effect to section 303Z41(6)
(including as applied by section 303Z45(5)), are payable
under this subsection in pursuance of provision under
section 303Z41(5) or, as the case may be, 303Z45(4);
(c) third, they must be applied in payment or reimbursement of
any reasonable costs incurred in storing or insuring the
property whilst detained under this Part and in realising the
property;
(d) fourth, they must be paid—
(i) if the property was forfeited by a magistrates’ court or
the High Court, into the Consolidated Fund;

(3) If what is realised under section 303Z48 represents part only of an
item of property, the reference in subsection (2)(c) to costs incurred
in storing or insuring the property is to be read as a reference to costs
incurred in storing or insuring the whole of the property.

Extended time for appealing in certain cases where deproscription order made
10Z7CH(1) This paragraph applies where—

(5) Where an authorised officer is satisfied that—
(a) it is not reasonably practicable to realise any cryptoasset,
or
(b) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the realisation
of any cryptoasset would be contrary to the public interest,

appeal may be made (whether under paragraph
10Z7CG or otherwise), or
(ii) if an appeal is made within that period, before the
appeal is determined or otherwise disposed of.
(7) The question of whether the realisation of the cryptoasset would
be contrary to the public interest is to be determined with
particular reference to how likely it is that the entry of the
cryptoasset into general circulation would facilitate criminal
conduct by any person.
Proceeds of realisation
10Z7CJ(1) This paragraph applies where any cryptoasset or other item of
property is realised under paragraph 10Z7CI.
(2) The proceeds of the realisation must be applied as follows—

property whilst detained under this Schedule and in
realising the property;

incurred in storing or insuring the property is to be read as a

of that right has to do with economic crime,
(c) any part of that disclosure is or would be made for a purpose

reasonably believes (or, as the case requires, believed) to be
evidence of the commission of an economic crime, or
(b) the defendant has (or, as the case requires, had) reason to suspect
that an economic crime may have occurred and believes (or, as the
case requires, believed) that the disclosure of the information
would facilitate an investigation into whether such a crime has (or
had) occurred.
(4) In determining whether any behaviour of the claimant falls within
subsection (1)(d), the court may, in particular, take into account—
(a) whether the behaviour is a disproportionate reaction to the matters
complained of in the claim, including whether the costs incurred by
the claimant are out of proportion to the remedy sought;
(b) whether the defendant has access to fewer resources with which to
defend the claim than another person against whom the claimant
could have brought (but did not bring) proceedings in relation to
the matters complained of in the claim;
(c) any relevant failure, or anticipated failure, by the claimant to
comply with a pre-action protocol, rule of court or practice
direction, or to comply with or follow a rule or recommendation of
a professional regulatory body.
