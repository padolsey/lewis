   <quote>After section 167L of the Companies Act 2006 (inserted by Schedule 2 to this
Act) insert—
“Directors: duties relating to ID verification and notification
167M Prohibition on director acting unless ID verified
(1) An individual must not act as a director of a company unless the
individual’s identity is verified (see section 1110A).
(2) A company must ensure that an individual does not act as a director
unless the individual’s identity is verified (see section 1110A).
(3) A person who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence.
(4) If a company contravenes subsection (2) an offence is committed by—
(a) the company, and
(b) every officer of the company who is in default.
For this purpose a shadow director is treated as an officer of the
company.
(5) A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary
conviction—
(a) in England and Wales, to a fine;
(b) in Scotland or Northern Ireland, to a fine not exceeding level 5
on the standard scale and, for continued contravention, a daily
default fine not exceeding one-tenth of level 5 on the standard

(6) The only consequences of contravening subsections (1) and (2) are the
offences provided for by this section (so that, for example, a
contravention does not in any way affect the validity of an individual’s
acts as a director).”</quote>

(3) HMRC information may not be disclosed by the registrar under section 1110F without authorisation from HMRC.
(4) If the registrar discloses HMRC information under section 1110F, the information must not be disclosed by the recipient, or by any person obtaining the information directly or indirectly from them, without authorisation from HMRC.

   <quote>(2) In subsection (2), after “not” insert “under subsection (1)”.
(3) After subsection (5) insert—
“(5A) On being satisfied as mentioned in section 47B(1) an appropriate
officer may seize any free property if the officer has reasonable
grounds for suspecting that it is a cryptoasset-related item.
(5B) A “cryptoasset-related item” is an item of property that is, or that
contains or gives access to information that is, likely to assist in the
seizure under subsection (1) of any cryptoasset.
(5C) The circumstances in which a cryptoasset is “seized” for the purposes
of subsection (1) include circumstances in which it is transferred into
a crypto wallet controlled by the appropriate officer.
(5D) If an appropriate officer is lawfully on any premises, the officer may,
for the purpose of—
(a) determining whether any property is a cryptoasset-related
item, or
(b) enabling or facilitating the seizure under subsection (1) of
any cryptoasset,
require any information which is stored in any electronic form and
accessible from the premises to be produced in a form in which it can
be taken away and in which it is visible and legible, or from which it
can readily be produced in a visible and legible form.
(5E) But subsection (5D) does not authorise an appropriate officer to
require a person to produce information which the person would be
entitled to refuse to provide on grounds of legal professional
privilege in proceedings in the High Court.
(5F) Where an appropriate officer has seized a cryptoasset-related item
under subsection (5A), they may use any information obtained from
it for the purpose of—
(a) identifying or gaining access to a crypto wallet, and
(b) by doing so, enabling or facilitating the seizure under
subsection (1) of any cryptoassets.”</quote>

(1) This section applies to cryptoassets which—
(a) are held by a person, and
(b) are held in a crypto wallet administered by a UK-connected
cryptoasset service provider,
but only so far as the cryptoassets are free property.
(2) Subsection (3) applies if—
(a) a confiscation order is made against a person holding
cryptoassets to which this section applies, and
(b) a receiver has not been appointed under section 50 in relation
to the cryptoassets.
(3) A magistrates’ court may order the UK-connected cryptoasset
service provider which administers the crypto wallet in which the
cryptoassets are held—
(a) to realise the cryptoassets, or a portion of the cryptoassets
having a specified value,
(b) to pay the proceeds of that realisation to the designated
officer for the court on account of, and up to a maximum of,
the amount payable under the confiscation order, and
(c) to the extent that the proceeds of the realisation exceed the
amount payable under the confiscation order, to pay the
excess to an appropriate officer identified in the order.
“Appropriate officer” has the same meaning as in section 41A.
(4) A person applying for an order under subsection (3) must give notice
of the application to the UK-connected cryptoasset service provider.
(5) Where the crypto wallet in which the cryptoassets are held is
administered on behalf of someone other than the person against
whom the confiscation order is made, a magistrates’ court—
(a) may make an order under subsection (3) only if the extent of
the person’s interest in the money has been determined
under section 10A, and
(b) must have regard to that determination in deciding what is
the appropriate order to make.
(6) If a UK-connected cryptoasset service provider fails to comply with
an order under subsection (3)—
(a) the magistrates’ court may order it to pay an amount not
exceeding £5,000, and
(b) for the purposes of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 the sum
is to be treated as adjudged to be paid by a conviction of the
court.
(7) In order to take account of changes in the value of money the
Secretary of State may by order substitute another sum for the sum
for the time being specified in subsection (6)(a).
(8) Where a UK-connected cryptoasset service provider—
(a) is required by an order under subsection (3) to realise a
portion of cryptoassets having a specified value, but
(b) on realising cryptoassets under the order, obtains proceeds of
an amount which differs from that value,
it does not fail to comply with the order solely because of that
difference in value, provided that it took reasonable steps to obtain
proceeds equal to the value specified."</quote>

   <summary>This section introduces provisions for the handling of cryptoassets in relation to confiscation orders. It outlines the powers of a magistrates' court to order a UK-connected cryptoasset service provider to realize and pay the proceeds of cryptoassets held in a crypto wallet towards a confiscation order.

(1) It is an offence for a person who is subject to director
disqualification sanctions to act as a director of a company or

promotion, formation or management of a company (but see
paragraph (2)).
(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply—

Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018, or
(b) to anything done under the authority of a licence issued by

(3) It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this
Article to prove that they did not know and could not reasonably
have been expected to know that they were subject to director
disqualification sanctions at the time at which they engaged in that
conduct.
(4) In this Article “person who is subject to director disqualification
sanctions” means a person who under regulations under section 1
of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 is a person
subject to director disqualification sanctions for the purposes of this
Article and section 11A of the Company Directors Disqualification

(2) After section 1002 insert—
“Registrar’s power to strike off company registered on false basis
1002A Power to strike off company registered on false basis
(1) The registrar may strike a company’s name off the register if the
registrar has reasonable cause to believe that—
(a) any information contained in the application for the
registration of the company, or in any application for
restoration of the company to the register, is misleading,
false or deceptive in a material particular, or
(b) any statement made to the registrar in connection with such
an application is misleading, false or deceptive in a material
particular.
(2) In subsection (1) the reference to an application includes any
documents delivered to the registrar in connection with the
application.
(3) The registrar may not exercise the power in subsection (1) unless—
(a) the registrar has published a notice in the Gazette that, at the
end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date of the
notice, the name of the company mentioned in the notice
will, unless cause is shown to the contrary, be struck off the
register and the company will be dissolved, and
(b) the period mentioned in paragraph (a) has expired.
(4) If the registrar exercises the power in subsection (1), the registrar
must publish a notice in the Gazette of the company’s name having
been struck off the register.
(5) On the publication of the notice in the Gazette the company is
dissolved.
(6) However—
(a) the liability (if any) of every director, managing officer or
member of the company continues and may be enforced as
if the company had not been dissolved, and
(b) nothing in this section affects the power of the court to wind
up a company the name of which has been struck off the
register.”</quote>
