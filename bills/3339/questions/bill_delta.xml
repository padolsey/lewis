   <quote>“1081A Registrar’s objectives to promote integrity of registers etc
(1) The registrar must, in performing the registrar’s functions, seek to
promote the following objectives.
Objective 1
Objective 1 is to ensure that any person who is required to deliver a
document to the registrar does so (and that the requirements for proper
delivery are complied with).
Objective 2
Objective 2 is to ensure that information contained in the register is
accurate and that the register contains everything it ought to contain.
Objective 3
Objective 3 is to minimise the risk of records kept by the registrar
creating a false or misleading impression to members of the public.
Objective 4
Objective 4 is to minimise the extent to which companies and others—
(a) carry out unlawful activities, or
(b) facilitate the carrying out by others of unlawful activities.
(2) In Objective 2 the reference to “the register” includes any records kept
by the registrar under any enactment.”</quote>

“Identity verification obligations for persons with significant control
790LI Initial identity verification: registrable persons
(1) This section applies in the following cases.
Case 1 is where—
(a) a company is incorporated in pursuance of an application for
registration containing a statement under section 12A(1)(a)
naming a person as someone who will, on the company’s
incorporation, become a registrable person (“the registrable
person”),
(b) the application does not include a statement under section
12B(2) in respect of the registrable person or it appears to the
registrar that the statement is false, and
(c) the company has not given a notice under section 790LD(1) in
respect of the person.
Case 2 is where—
(a) the registrar is notified under section 790LA that a person has
become a registrable person in relation to a company (“the
registrable person”), and
(b) the notice does not include a statement under section 790LB(1)
or it appears to the registrar that the statement is false.
(2) The registrar must direct the registrable person to deliver to the
registrar, within the period of 14 days beginning with the date of the
direction, a statement confirming that the person’s identity is verified
(see section 1110A).
(3) The registrar may by further direction extend that period by up to 14
days at a time.
(4) A direction under this section must be in writing.
(5) A direction given to a person under this section lapses if notice is later
given under section 790LD(1) in respect of that person.
(6) In this section “registrable person” does not include a person
mentioned in section 790C(12)(a) to (d).</quote>

imprisonment for a term not exceeding the general limit in a
magistrates’ court or a fine (or both);
(b) on summary conviction in Scotland, to imprisonment for a term
not exceeding 12 months or a fine not exceeding the statutory

   <summary>The amendment makes it an offence for a person to fail to comply with a notice under section 12 or 13 without a reasonable excuse. If the offence is committed by a legal entity, every officer of the entity who is in default also commits the offence. It is a defence for a person charged with this offence to prove that the requirement to give information was frivolous or vexatious. The penalties for this offence vary depending on the jurisdiction and whether the conviction is summary or on indictment.</summary>

crime, has decided to take safeguarding action (or would have decided to take

available to other customers of A.</quote>

(b) give rise to any civil liability, on the part of R, to the person to whom
the disclosed information relates.</quote>

other person of the disclosed information, for the purposes of enabling a
disclosure to be made by them to which subsection (1) applies, does not—
